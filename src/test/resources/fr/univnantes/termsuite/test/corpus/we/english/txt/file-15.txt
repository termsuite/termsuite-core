GUIDANCE ON THE CONTENT AND CONTEXT FOR THIS UNIT
This Unit has been developed to provide candidates with a range of practical skills focused within the areas of mechanical and electrical engineering. The candidates will gain knowledge on using wind energy to generate a source of electricity suitable for use in a domestic building and will test and evaluate a wind turbine's efficiency. This Unit has a strong focus on individual and team working skills, where candidates will work in small groups to manufacture, assemble, and test a wind turbine. Outcomes 1 and 2 have been developed to ensure each candidate has the opportunity to demonstrate competence in the skills required for this Unit. This should prepare them for the team working exercises in Outcomes 3 and 4 when assembling and testing a wind turbine. Testing should include the use of a voltmeter to measure the output voltage over a set time. Practical skills and team working employability skills are essential for this Unit and candidates are required to evaluate their contribution to the Outcome of the group exercise. Team roles and task functions will be evaluated, ie their role within the team and the tasks the team has to do, and how the team went about doing it. The generic employability skills which are developed in this Unit are: ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ maintaining good timekeeping and attendance maintaining a tidy work place seeking feedback and advice following instructions working co-operatively with others selecting and using tools correctly and for the purpose they were designed using Personal Protective Equipment correctly and working safely following basic drawings correctly checking quality of work working to agreed deadlines organising work effectively working confidently willingness to learn new skills or techniques working independently reflecting on own performance learning from past experiences developing presentation skills developing creativity skills

GUIDANCE ON LEARNING AND TEACHING APPROACHES FOR THIS UNIT
It is important that there is an induction to the Unit that will include employability skills and health and safety awareness. This Unit involves experiential learning through the various practical experiences and activities. Candidates should experience workshop conditions and should be encouraged to perform tasks and conduct themselves in a manner appropriate to the workplace. General vocational skills, such as selecting and maintaining tools and equipment, are integrated with practical domestic energy engineering activities within the Unit. As well as carrying out practical tasks, candidates will also learn from brief lessons on health and safety and workshop protocol. Teaching and learning approaches will also include demonstrations of practical work by tutors. Short lessons on specific aspects of industrial practice and the correct use of tools will prove invaluable at intervals throughout the learning experience. These may be followed by brief practical sessions in which the candidates practice the skill emphasised by the demonstration. Integrated into the Unit are the employability skills that employers value. It should be stressed that all the employability skills are developed in this Unit but only specified employability skills will be assessed. Employability skills are a focus of this Unit and should be promoted from Unit induction to Unit completion. In order to raise the candidates' awareness of local industries and the realities of the workplace, visits to local energy installations or companies could be arranged, if appropriate. Equally, visiting speakers from local domestic energy firms should be encouraged. Additional useful material and employment opportunities can be resourced by researching local domestic energy firms or from the internet. This Unit should be delivered in a workshop environment. Practical demonstrations and practical exercises should be used to ensure candidates have the necessary skills and knowledge to carry out the tasks in the assessment. It is essential that all candidates have the opportunity to develop a full range of the necessary domestic wind turbine skills; this can be more difficult when candidates are working in teams. It is recommended that all candidates work on small individual exercises in the first instance (Outcomes 1 and 2). This will ensure all candidates can play a full role in the team working part of this project based practical element (Outcomes 3 and 4). Candidates could investigate the wind available at their site through the internet or from tables. This could help inform the evaluations they will make on the effectiveness of the domestic wind turbine in operation. Where this information is not available on the internet, candidates should be given it in a tabular form. Individual exercises could include the following: ♦ ♦ ♦ cutting, filing, and drilling use of standard parts wiring up a light circuit

The assembly of the domestic wind turbine should start with the team members drawing up a plan which lists the tasks to be undertaken to assemble the wind turbine, along with the names of the individuals who have agreed to carry out the tasks. All the components for the wind turbine will be prepared and ready for assembly, although a limited amount of mechanical and electrical work will be needed. Once the wind turbine has been assembled, it will be ready for testing. Initial testing can be carried out in the workshop using two mobile electric fans. Switching between them will test the turbine's ability to alter direction for a change in wind direction and also its electrical output. Testing in an outside environment should supplement the initial testing where the actual wind available will give a more realistic idea of the effectiveness of the assembled wind turbine. Technical evaluations of the assembled wind turbine should include a comparison of completed work against the criteria given in the brief. Personal and team working evaluations should be included to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of working in a team and comparing this against the advantages and disadvantages of working as an individual. Team working tasks and roles within the team that candidates should consider during the assembly of the wind turbine are: ♦ Roles: - leader - worker - finisher - problem solver Tasks: - completing the assembly within time - working co-operatively with others - building up relationships between team members - getting encouragement from team members - giving encouragement to other team members

♦

Teams should ideally be made up of two candidates, but teams of three candidates would be acceptable. Where this Unit is delivered as part of the Intermediate 2 Energy Course, there are good opportunities to integrate the practical skills with the development and assessment of generic employability skills in the Energy: Employability and Careers Unit. The candidate's review of progress in employability skills could be based on the practical activities carried out in this Unit.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORE SKILL DEVELOPMENT
In this Unit there are good opportunities for candidates to develop the Core Skill of Team Working during the assembly of the domestic wind turbine and Problem Solving in the use of drawings and specifications to solve the build sequence, method, and tools to be used. There are opportunities to develop aspects of the Core Skill of Communication, both in the investigation and presentation, of findings.

GUIDANCE ON APPROACHES TO ASSESSMENT FOR THIS UNIT
Opportunities for the use of e-assessment E-assessment may be appropriate for some assessments in this Unit. By e-assessment we mean assessment which is supported by information and communications technology (ICT), such as e-testing or the use of e-portfolios or e-checklists. Centres which wish to use e-assessment must ensure that the national standard is applied to all candidate evidence and that conditions of assessment as specified in the Evidence Requirements are met, regardless of the mode of gathering evidence. Further advice is available in SQA Guidelines on Online Assessment for Further Education (AA1641, March 2003), SQA Guidelines on e-assessment for Schools (BD2625, June 2005). The assessment of the mechanical/electrical skills will be evidenced by practical assignments involving the manufacture of a small artefact and the wiring up of a simple electrical circuit. These will be supported by assessor observation checklists. It is anticipated that candidates will be given as much practice as possible in mechanical/electrical techniques prior to assessment. The assessment activities should also make an important contribution to the learning process. The practical skills and team working skills are assessed in different Outcomes; Outcomes 1 and 2 are where candidates are assessed on their individual practical skills, and Outcomes 3, 4, and 5 are for assessing their team working skills. The team working skills will be assessed as they work in teams producing a wind turbine. Formative assessment may include practical exercises in metal cutting, drilling, assembly, and electrical wiring. These practical exercises will develop the candidate's skills to a level suitable for progressing to summative assessment. The recommended approach to summative assessment in this Unit is as follows: Outcomes 1 and 2 Candidates will carry out practical exercises according to a given brief. In doing this, they will produce artefacts which will be used as the basis for a discussion between the assessor and the candidate. The assessment evidence will be the completed signed assessor observation checklist which will detail the essential steps in the process as expressed in the Performance Criteria. Outcomes 3 and 4 Teams will carry out a practical exercise according to a given brief. In doing this, they will produce and test a small wind turbine which will be used as the basis for a discussion between the assessor and the team. The assessment evidence will be the completed signed assessor observation checklist which will detail the essential steps in the process as expressed in the Performance Criteria.

Outcome 5 The assessment is based on the end product of the Outcome which will be a presentation in a form of the team's choosing. Forms of presentation might include, for example, a short talk, poster, leaflet, diagram, or PowerPoint presentation. An assessor checklist identifying the critical aspects of the presentation, regardless of form, should be completed and retained for each candidate. A self build or pre-manufactured wind turbine can be used in the planning, assembly, and testing sequence in Outcomes 3, 4, and 5.
