There are many different areas of this problem that were covered. Farmer Bob needs a certain wind turbine that would best suite his needs. Farmer Bob also needs a way of storing enough energy to create at least two days worth of electricity. Another thing that farmer Bob wanted was to see if it was possible to run his cars, trucks, or other machinery using energy from the wind turbine. To start out research on what was needed, the electrical use of average homes in the area was needed to see how much energy was going to be used in two days. One possibility that was looked at is to either use a wind turbine that does not produce the needed amount of electricity for every month, but does create excess electricity for a few months. Another possibility is to just use a wind turbine that creates excess electricity all year round Through research on the internet, it was found that for two days farmer Bob would need 82 kWh of electricity. To get 82 kWh of electricity in two days, the storage device would need to be able to produce 1.71 kW of electricity every hour. These were our only constraints. The ideas the team came up with that would store enough energy for two days were a water tower, flywheel, batteries, and hydrogen. While looking at each one of these storage possibilities there were factors such as costs, size, reliability, and safety that would aid in determining which storage device would be used by farmer Bob. When looking at the separate devices that would store the energy needed, there were seven areas of importance that were looked at while doing research. Each area was weighted according to importance so that when all seven of the areas percentages were added up, they equaled one-hundred percent. See Table 1. 1 .1 Table 1. 1 .1 Design criteria for each major area of importance Areas of Importance Percentage Initial Construction Cost: 25% Reliability: 20% Functionality: 15% Maintenance Cost: 15% Ease of Maintenance: 10% Safety: 10% Size: 5% We will go into the data for each area of importance later in the main sections of energy storage. Batteries Batteries were the first storage device thought of, but the idea was quickly discarded. Batteries would be much less efficient than any other storage idea. The batteries would also have to be replaced much more often. The initial price to purchase the batteries wouldn't be quite as expensive as some of the other ideas, but because they would need to be replaced often the price would increase quickly, especially during the cold months. This is because batteries tend to drain their energy much faster during the cold months. Water Tower Through research and calculations many advantages of the water tower were found. One of the advantages was that the water tower would use ground water, which is a renewable source. Since farmer Bob lives on a farm he most likely already has a well to get the water for his tower. Another advantage is that once it is up and running it will be very safe and will need little maintenance. Also, unless there is a major problem with the water tower, there will be a low maintenance cost. Plus, since there are so many water towers all over the United States, it would be easy to find someone to build it. There were also some disadvantages that came with using a water tower. The main problem with using a tower for creating the energy for the two days is that it would be extremely expensive. They found that the water tower that would be used would cost nearly $1,000,000. Another disadvantage is that it would be extraordinarily large. But, this is not too much of a problem because it will be located on a farm, which has a large amount of space. A big disadvantage of using a tower is that it would have no functionality. The water tower couldn't help run a car or truck, the only thing it could do is produce electricity for the house. Flywheel The team that did research on the flywheel decided to use steel to make it. This is because steel is fairly heavy, easy to find, and cheap to use. The reason the flywheel would need to be made of a heavy material like steel is to cut down on the overall size of it. The flywheel is a very simple design, so it wouldn't be that hard to find a company to build it. The flywheel, as long as enclosed, would be quite safe because there aren't too many small hi-tech parts to the flywheel, but the sheer weight of flywheel could cause it to be dangerous. Depending on what breaks on it, the cost of maintenance could be very low, but if something such as the flywheel itself breaks than the cost of maintenance would be very expensive. Also, there would be low maintenance because flywheels are typically long-life machines that don't break down easily. Some disadvantages of using a flywheel are that it would have to be extremely large to produce the needed electricity. Not only would it take up a large amount of space, but it would also be very heavy. This flywheel being used would have no functionality either. It would be too big to fit into a car or some other vehicle that farmer Bob would have. Depending on what breaks on it, the maintenance cost could be high. Also, depending on what breaks, the flywheels weight would cause a big problem in the ease of maintenance. Lastly the cost of the flywheel would be about the same as the water tower. Hydrogen While doing research on hydrogen many advantages were found. One of the advantages was the initial cost of getting and setting up the hydrogen machines because it would be cheap compared to the water tower and the flywheel. Depending on the quality of the machine that farmer Bob bought, the maintenance of the machine could be easy. This is because some machines tell you exactly what and where the problem is, the only thing is that a machine like this costs much more than the simple machines that don't tell you were all the problems are. The size of using hydrogen was a big advantage also. The machines that we would use are about the same size as regular household washing machine. As long as the hydrogen was in solid form, it would be pretty safe to use. Also, hydrogen has a good functionality. It could be used to help run farmer Bob's trucks, cars, or any other machines. Although there were many advantages of hydrogen, there were also some disadvantages, but not many. The main disadvantage would be getting the hydrogen. Another problem that may occur, depending on what kind of hydrogen machine is used, is that finding the problem, if one does occur, could prove to be difficult. If farmer Bob buys a cheap machine he will have to have an expert come in and look at it, which will not be easy because there are not many experts on hydrogen in this region of the U.S.. When assigned the percentages to each area of importance for the water tower, flywheel, and hydrogen there was big difference between the numbers. The flywheel received 450 points, the water tower received 620 points, and the hydrogen received 685 points. Hydrogen is going to be used as our storage device due to the fact that it received a greater number of points. Section 2: Wind Turbine Research When we first got this problem there was only guarantee in it. That was that we had to use a wind turbine to harness the power of the wind. Therefore, we needed to become familiar with the system of the turbine. Meaning that we needed to learn the different parts of the wind turbine, and how they converted the wind into a form of energy capable of being stored. We first started by looking up the basic system of the wind turbine. This consisted of the wind blowing and then turning the blades of the wind turbine. The turning of the blades then creates mechanical energy which can be stored in various forms. This is the basics to the system that we will be using. Figure 2.1 Within this diagram you can see the many parts to the wind turbine. The rotor blades are what turn from the force of the wind blowing on them. These rotor blades then turn the gears within the gearbox. Then the gearing of the system powers a generator which is able to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy and send it through to the grid connection. From the grid connection is where you would then pull your power from. Within the rotor hub that the rotor blades are attached to there are mechanisms that control the things such as pitch and controlling the speed at which the blades spin. Wind turbines tend to have brakes in them that stop them from turning when wind speeds get too high for the wind turbine to be able to stay together as it spins. Within the hub is a pitch mechanism that controls the angle at which the blades are tilted. Next there is the yaw system which controls the turning of the turbine to catch optimum wind for the most energy possible. By catching the optimum wind we will increase our chance of gaining the most power possible through the generator and then storing it in some sort of storage system. This system works to gather the most power capable of the wind turbine and generator. Then this energy is stored for usage in houses and on equipment. This setup allows for the turbine to turn the with the wind and change orientation so that it is always capable of catching the wind at an optimum level. Section 3: Storage Research After looking into wind towers and turbines, research was done to find ways to take and store its electricity. Three main areas were chosen to be researched further. These included how to store energy from the wind using kinetic energy, gravitational energy and chemical energy. Three different groups were formed to research the solutions and when finding details about each solution, the groups presented their results. The kinetic energy group decided on a solution that would involve a flywheel to store the energy. The gravitational energy group found a solution that involved the storage of energy using a water tower. Finally, the chemical energy group decided to use hydrogen as storage for the energy made by the wind turbine. Section 3.1: Flywheel The next step of the process was to research whether kinetic energy could be stored and whether it was a feasible solution to the problem. Kinetic energy is the energy an object has due to its motion. After investigating the topic, several possibilities for this type of energy storage were found. The most frequently mentioned solution was what is known as a flywheel. Because this seemed to have the most information about it, this was the option chosen for the potential storage system. The flywheel has been around for a very long time; they were especially popular before batteries were generally used and are still used today. Some places they can be found are in potters' wheels, gears of clocks, and in automobiles. The flywheel is some type of wheel or disk attached to a shaft that is spinning. As the shaft spins, the wheel spins as well, storing kinetic energy over time. This stored energy can then be transferred as kinetic energy still or converted into some other form of energy. In the problem at hand, the kinetic energy would be converted into electric energy and could then be used in the farmer's house and for his other Figure 3.1.1: A flywheel in a race car . electric needs. Figure 3.1.2 : NASA flywheel Energy Requirements After learning what a flywheel was and how it worked, the next step was to design one for the problem. The first calculation needed was how much energy the flywheel needed to store. Since wind is unpredictable, it was decided to look for a solution that would hold two days worth of energy. This number was figured by taking an estimate a student's summer electric bill, which was around $100. This made the price of energy for two days to be around $7. After looking at information from the Lincoln Power Company, the price per kilowatt-hour was said to be $0.051. With all of this information, it was determined that the flywheel had to hold Joules of energy. Design With this known, possibilities for the actual flywheel could be determined. The factors that went into this next step were how big could the flywheel be, how fast could it safely spin, and what materials could feasibly be used in terms of cost and availability. It was decided that steel and aluminum would be the best choices for the project; therefore, these were the two possibilities researched in more detail. Several calculations were made to determine other factors of the flywheel. These included finding equations for the height and mass of the flywheel as well as other values needed to find them. An in-depth list of equations is given in Appendix A . Two possible designs were researched. One was that of simply a solid disk attached to the shaft. The other was a cylinder with sixty percent of the middle hollowed out. To attach this to the shaft, rods would have to be placed in the middle. For the solutions found, twelve such rods were used for stability and safety. For both possible designs and both materials, several combinations of radius and angular velocity were put into the equation to determine the heights. The radii tested were between one and five meters. The velocity was between five and twenty-five meters per second. By putting these values into a spreadsheet, the height for each combination could be found. Also in this spreadsheet, the mass of each solution was found to see which combinations were too heavy or too large to be conceivable, and therefore could not be used. From here, it was decided that the solid structure weighed too much and so the hollowed out version was the one further pursued. Figure 3.1.4 : Masses of different options Also from this same spreadsheet, aluminum was dropped as a possible material. Since the material weighed less, the flywheel, which would already have to be very large when built with steel, would have to be even larger. Figure 3.1.5 : Heights of flywheels with rods at 17.5 rad/s. The y-axis is the natural log value of the height. The next stage was to determine which combination would be the best in terms of a reasonable radius, height, and velocity. The combination that was picked as the best possible was that of a steel flywheel with a radius of 3.5 meters, an angular velocity of 17.5 radians per second, and a height of about 2 meters. Since the height was so much smaller than the radius, it was also determined that it would be best for the flywheel to have a vertical axis. Legend for Figures 6-7 Figure 3.1.6 : Comparing natural log of heights of the system for each angular velocity. Figure 3.1.7 : Comparing natural log of mass of the system for each angular velocity. After finding prices on the internet for steel, the price for the flywheel was determined from the price found for bar-reinforcing steel. This price was $0.88 per pound2. The price of the flywheel alone came out to be $822,305.10. Installation and custom building was estimated to be this same price, making the total installed flywheel system $1.65 million. Advantages and Disadvantages The advantages to using a flywheel are that it is quite easy to maintain. Reliability is very high; there are no intricate or very delicate parts. Along with this, a specialist is not really required if something goes wrong. As long as the flywheel is enclosed in some type of building, it can be considered very safe. However, this system has disadvantages as well. First of all, the sheer size of the flywheel makes it difficult to do much with. Whenever it might need to be lifted, cranes must be hired. Next, there is the cost. Since the cost is estimated at over $1.5 million, it is unlikely that this would be the most cost effective system for the farmer. Also, even though it would be quite easy to carry electric energy into the house, transferring it to cars and trucks with this system is virtually impossible. Final Decision The flywheel was then rated to see how well it scored with the criteria. Table 3.1 below shows the exact numbers with a 1 through 10 rating, with 10 being the best. The flywheels disadvantages, functionality and size, scored very low. As is shown, reliability and safety are the advantages to using this system. The weights for each of the criteria were applied and the overall score found for the flywheel was 450. Table 3. 1: Scoring the Flywheel Criteria Rating Construction Cost 4 Reliability 6 Functionality 2 Maintenance Cost 5 Ease of Maintenance 4 Safety 7 Size 3 Since this score was much lower than that of the other two systems, the flywheel was rejected as a possibility for the farmer. This was mainly due to the size and cost of the system. Since this solution was not chosen as the best answer to the problem, research on this particular system stopped and was then focused on the system that seemed to provide the best solution. Section 3.2 : Water Tower s Introduction to Gravitational E nergy Energy is everywhere. It is sometimes a challenge to find a way to store energy to be changed later into electrical energy. One option is to store energy as gravitational potential energy. The first idea that came up with F igure 3 . 2. 1 was to lift a lot of weight in the form of water high enough into the air using a water tower. Gravitational E nergy What was used was the idea that if we use the formula for potential energy (Potential Energy = Mass x Gravity x Height) to figure out how much water needs to be how high. The energy works by lifting a mass to a certain high enough to store enough energy to run a home for several days. When a mass falls the stored energy or potential energy is changed into kinetic energy. In order to produce a few hundred kilowatts of energy needed the mass would have to be very large and very heavy. This would result in it being very difficult to lift as well as being fairly dangerous. We came up with the idea of using water. Water was available, and easier to work with than a solid weight would be. Figure 3.2.1 Force and W ater One of the first things that we need to figure out was how much a gallon of water weighs. We found that one gallon of water = 8.33 lbs. The amount of energy due to the force of gravity and mass are able to produce is what we will use to Figure 3.2.2 create the energy needed. We used the amount of energy we needed to produce a graph that showed the size of water tower as well as the height difference between the water tower and the place that we collect the energy. In order to produce a tower that is large enough to collect the amount of energy needed the tower would have to be rather large. The amount of force that is created by storing water is increased the higher up the water tower is. So the higher the storage part of the tower is and the further down the water is released the more force it has. The force is what is used to turn generators the greater the force the more energy is produced. It would work like a dam does. Figure 3.2.3 Types of T owers There are several different types of water towers, a few of which are shown in F igure 3.2 . 4 . Some of these towers have the ability to hold the amount of water that we are going to need in order to store the amount of energy that is needed to supply a farm for a short period of time. Figure 3.2.4 Double Ellipsoidal Elevate Toro Sphere Ped-Cone Fluted Pillar /Composite SHAPE \* MERGEFORMAT SHAPE \* MERGEFORMAT SHAPE \* MERGEFORMAT SHAPE \* MERGEFORMAT C ost of the Water Tower P roject The cost of the tower however would be rather large. Depending on the size of the hill that that is used to our advantage around North West Iowa the average hill is about 150 feet the tower would still have to be about one million gallons. The cost of building a water tower depends on the size and location. There for unless we know what the site is like we cannot have a reasonable estimate of how much it will cost. Additional to the cost of the water tower is the cost of the pipe that has to carry the water from the tower to the area where we would gather the energy. A few examples of the cost of building a water tower may give you an example of how much it would cost to build a water tower in the area. In Odebolt Iowa a water tower with a capacity of 200,000 gallons was built for a cost of $350,700. In Wisconsin Rapids a 2 million gallon water tower was built for $1.7 million. So the size of water tower that we will need in order to store the amount of water needed is going to cost a large amount. In conclusion, in order to store enough energy to sustain a farm in Iowa for a short period of about two days is very difficult. It is possible; however, the installation cost is not efficient. Its maintenance is fairly easy. It's very safe to store energy in this manner. It's also a very reliable source of energy storage. Not a very practical way to store energy. Section 3.3: Basic Hydrogen Fuel Information Hydrogen, unlike any other fuel, can be produced continuously from an unlimited source, water. It is the most common element in the universe. The production of hydrogen is simple and can also be produced using a variety of different fuels. Through the electrolysis of water, hydrogen can be continuously produced as long as electricity is being supplied for the electrolysis process. Therefore the characteristic of having a continuous and unlimited supply of the hydrogen allows it to be a reliable source of fuel. Hydrogen Safety All fuels are combustible, including hydrogen. But certain characteristics of hydrogen allow it to have many advantages over fossil fuels in terms of safety. Being the lightest fuel, hydrogen's low density and ability to rapidly disperse allows it to escape into the air if a leak occurs. In addition, hydrogen burns upward, producing only water and heat as a byproduct, and burns out faster in comparison to gasoline products. Moreover, propane and gasoline have higher densities and slow dispersal rates that increase the risk of an explosion. Hydrogen on the other hand has a lower energy density, therefore producing less heat in a fire and posing less of an explosion risk. Hydrogen levels need to reach a concentration of 4% to 17% in the surrounding atmosphere in order to pose a danger. A concentration of gasoline only has to reach 1% before it is in danger of ignition. The chart below, Table 3. 3.1 , contains the characteristics of gasoline, methane, and hydrogen relating to ignition and explosion hazards.

Nejat Veziroglu. Hydrogen Energy System: A Permanent Solution to Global Problems. University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124, USA Hydrogen gas is also colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nevertheless highly flammable. A mixture of hydrogen with air burns with a pale blue almost invisible flame. These characteristics mark a hydrogen leak as relatively hard to detect. Although hydrogen gas is non-toxic it may provoke suffocation by diminishing the concentration of oxygen in the air below life sustaining levels. Of course the hydrogen necessary for asphyxiation is well within the flammable range, therefore making fire the primary hazard. The storage of hydrogen can become dangerous. The best way to prevent dangers posed by the storage of hydrogen include adequate ventilation, prevention of the formation of combustible fuel (oxidant mixtures), and removing potential sources of ignition. Availability The hydrogen market is rapidly expanding. The advantage of being portable, reliable and available in unlimited amounts has aroused much research and interest. There are several companies that produce hydrogen system products such as storage devices, electrolyzers, and fuel cells. Hydrogen systems are becoming even more common today. The company siGen has recently announced a $350,000 contract for the installation of 2 wind turbines, electrolyzer, hydrogen storage facilities, and a 5kW fuel cell system at a park in Scotland. In addition, much research is still being done to make hydrogen solutions more feasible and cost effective. The Hydrogen System The hydrogen system specific to this project took into account three main components: the electrolyzer, storage tanks, and the fuel cell. This report concentrates on these three main components. Albeit the main components constitute the bulk of the cost, various purifiers, regulators, converters, and special connections are required to make the system work. For calculations and conversions regarding hydrogen, refer to Appendix B . In diagram, Figure 3. 3.1 , the wide spectrum of usage for hydrogen the hydrogen system can be seen. Figure 3.3.1 * Picture taken from Ovonics Electrolyzer An electrolyzer is a device that uses a method of electrolysis to convert water (or other hydrogen containing fuels) into gaseous hydrogen. There are several ways to generate hydrogen, a few of these include hydrocarbon conversion, ammonia dissociation, methanol reforming, and sponge iron-oxidation. However, these techniques give an emission of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, while water electrolysis produces only hydrogen and oxygen as an output. The production of hydrogen has always been common and electrolyzers have a broad range of use. Such applications for an electrolyzer include: providing O2 for life support; providing H2 for corrosion control, electric generator cooling and electronic and materials processing, gas chromatograph detectors, metal forming, and welding. There are two main types of electrolyzers: the Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) electrolyzer, and the Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. The PEM electrolyzer was chosen for this project due to its ability to generate pure hydrogen from water at pressures around 200 psig or higher, therefore eliminating a need for a compressor. The PEM electrolyzer is an important component of the hydrogen system. When connected to a water supply and an electrical output it can generate hydrogen gas at a constant pressure. Theoretically, electrolyzers split water into Hydrogen gas at an electric potential of 1.23 volts. Water enters the electrolyzer through a connection port. The Hydrogen ions then gather towards the negatively charge cathode while the oxygen molecules gather at the positively charged anode. The Hydrogen gas is then transported out of the electrolyzer, while oxygen is emitted into the air. The electrolyzer can be connected directly to a fuel cell to generate electricity, but it is typically connected to a hydrogen storage device. The hydrogen storage device receives the Hydrogen output from the electrolyzer and stores the hydrogen gas as a metal hydride, liquid, or gas. Figure 3.3.2 H2O ( H2 + O2 + Heat *Picture taken from Greenwinds, www.pege.org/greenwinds/ electrolyzer.htm A typical Electrolyzer has 85% efficiency. Moreover, commercial electrolyzers can output hydrogen gas at a pressure of 100 to 500 psig. The range of pressure output is also increasing; high pressure electrolyzers of 1000 to 4000 psig are becoming available in the market. Hydrogen Storage Hydrogen can be stored in a variety of ways, each of which caries its own specific advantages and disadvantages. Hydrogen is relatively non-corrosive, therefore the cost of specially designed materials is reduced. But embrittlement may occur in some metals at elevated temperatures and pressures. Below are the different types of hydrogen storage methods that were considered for this project. Liquid Hydrogen Hydrogen is available in a liquid state, but only at extremely cold temperatures. Because of the cold temperatures equipment must be specially designed. Liquid hydrogen typically has to be stored at 20 Kelvin or -253o C. The cooling and compressing process also requires energy, resulting in a loss of about 30% of the energy that the liquid hydrogen is storing. After hydrogen is produced, the gaseous hydrogen is then compressed, cooled to low cryogenic temperatures by the use of heat exchangers and tube expanders. Liquid hydrogen is normally stored in onsite storage systems typically consisting of a tank, vaporizer, and controls. These systems are selected in accordance to usage rate, pressure, and regulations. The tanks are cylindrical in shape and usually placed in a horizontal position. Liquid hydrogen tanks are vacuum insulated, with pressure relief valves located on both ends in order to protect the tanks. Liquid hydrogen tank capacities can range from 1500 gallons to 25,000 gallons There are safety concerns involved with the liquid storage of hydrogen and the maintenance of the cryogenic tanks. Moreover, the ease of use is diminished whilst using liquid hydrogen. Extreme care is taken when dealing with the liquid, protective clothing is always worn in order to prevent exposure to the extremely cold liquid and hydrogen vapors. The major disadvantage of liquid hydrogen is cost, and ease of usage. It is rather expensive to manufacture insulated cryogenic tanks for the storage of Hydrogen. Details of the expenses and specifications concerning the vessels specific to the project are located in section 5.2. Figure 3.3.3 *Picture Taken from a Stanford webpage, STS-93 Shuttle Launch, http://rescomp.stanford.edu/~stanj/Travel/STS-93/ Gaseous Hydrogen Gaseous Hydrogen can be stored in several different ways. It may be compressed into gas cylinders by oil lubricated compressors, stored into tube trailers, or stored as a highly compressed gas in storage tanks. Cylinders The cylinders are usually tapered to a small opening on the top where a valve or any other suitable outlet connection is located. The cylinder is usually filled in with hydrogen pressures ranging from 1000 psig to 4000 psig. The amount of gas in the cylinder is determined by the pressure, temperature, cylinder size, and cylinder pressure rating. Cylinders have the advantage of being mobile, but a major disadvantage is that cylinders of more than 300 SCF are quite rare. Details of the expenses and specifications concerning the cylinders specific to the project are located in section 5.2. Tube trailers Stationary tubes or hydril tube modules store large quantities of hydrogen. These tubes are usually tapered on both ends to which connector valves, or safety devices can be attached. They are commonly mounted on a truck trailer chassis. The tube capacities can reach up to 150,000 SCF, with an average pressure of 2,640 psig. Hydrogen tube trailers are usually a good choice when mobility and immense hydrogen quantities are the major deciding factors. Since this is not the case regarding the current project, hydrogen tube trailers are not recommended as a medium of storage. Compressed Tanks Hydrogen can be compressed into high-pressure tanks. This process requires energy to accomplish and the space that the compressed gas occupies is usually very large. A hydrogen gas tank would be more than 3,000 times bigger than the gasoline tank for the same amount of energy stored. Compressing the gas is also expensive and must be periodically tested and inspected to ensure safety. These disadvantages proved compressed hydrogen tanks as a poor option for this project. Details of the expenses and specifications concerning the tanks specific to the project are located in section 5.2. Metal Hydride Tanks Metal hydrides are made of combinations of metallic alloys that act like a sponge soaking up water. The metal hydrides can absorb hydrogen and release it later, either at room temperature or through the heating of the tank. One disadvantage is that the ratio of percentage of gas absorbed to volume of the metal is rather low, but hydrides offer a valuable solution to hydrogen storage. Metal hydrides offer the advantages of safely delivering hydrogen at a constant pressure. Yet a major disadvantage of metal hydrides includes high costs. Details of the expenses and specifications concerning the vessels specific to the project are located in section 5.2. Carbon N anotubes Carbon nanotubes are microscopic tubes of carbon that store hydrogen in microscopic pores on the tubes and within the tube structures. They are similar to metal hydrides for storing and releasing hydrogen, but the main advantage of carbon nanotubes is the amount of hydrogen they are able to store. Although this seems like a good option for the project it was not considered any further because carbon nanotubes are still in the research and development stage. Figure 3.3.4 (a)Hydrogen tube trailer, (b) Hydrogen gaseous cylinders, and (c) compressed hydrogen storage * Picture taken from Ovonics Fuel Cell A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that is capable of delivering electrical energy continuously by a reaction of a fuel and an oxidant gas at an efficiency range of 50%-60%. A fuel cell resembles a battery, but unlike a battery it does not need continuous replacement or recharging. A fuel cell will continuously produce electricity and heat as long as it is supplied with hydrogen gas. The fuel cell consists of an electrolyte in between two electrodes, called the anode and the cathode. Hydrogen from the storage units and oxygen from the air are pumped into the fuel cell. Activated by a catalyst, the hydrogen gathers to the anode, while the oxygen ions gather towards cathode. The hydrogen atoms separate into protons and electrons. The electrons pass through an electric circuit creating a flow of electricity. The protons, however, migrate to the cathode through a membrane to reunite with the oxygen molecules to produce water and heat. Figure 3.3.5 *Picture taken from the NASA Electrochemistry Website, http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/Electrochemistry/doc/fuelcell.html There were four primary fuel cell technologies considered for this project:- Table 3.3.2 Fuel Cell Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Solid Oxide Alkaline Anode & Cathode Made of finely dispersed platinum catalyst on carbon paper Fluorocarbon ion exchange Lanthanum magnate cathode and a nickel-zirconia anode Electrolyte Silicon carbide matrix Polymeric membrane Thin layer of zirconium oxide as a solid ceramic electrolyte Potassium hydroxide Advantages Most commercially developed fuel cel l. Operates at relatively low temperatures and can vary its output to meet shifting power demands. Excellent for small applications . Promising for high powered applications, electrical generating stations R egenerative or reversible fuel cel l can produce electricity from oxygen and hydrogen, but can also be reversed to work as an electrolyzer . The PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell was chosen for this project since it can operate at relatively low temperatures of 80˚C allowing it to warm up quickly and not need expensive containment structures. Furthermore only relatively low temperature fuel cells are attractive for the PEM electrolyzer. The PEM fuel cell is also more versatile in relation to output. For a given volume or weight, the PEM generates the most power of any fuel cell. The PEM can also be connected to a hydrogen storage tank that stores solid, gaseous, or liquid hydrogen. All these advantages made the PEM fuel cell the optimal choice. R ating The Hydrogen storage system was rated for each criterion on a scale of zero to ten with ten being the greatest, see Figure 3.3.6 . These ratings were then used to compare the hydrogen system to other alternative solutions for storing energy. Figure 3.3.6 The Hydrogen system was rated by specific criteria agreed upon by the team. Section 3.4: Storage Decision Table 3.4 Decision Matrix Criteria Weight, W% Alternative Solutions Flywheel Water Tower Hydrogen Rating, R R x W Rating, R R x W Rating, R R x W Installation Costs 25 4 100 5 125 8 200 Reliability 20 6 120 9 180 7 140 Functionality 15 2 30 2 30 10 150 Maintenance Costs 15 5 75 8 120 4 60 Maintenance Ease 10 4 40 7 70 2 20 Safety 10 7 70 8 80 7 70 Size 5 3 15 3 15 9 45 Total Score 450 620 685 Rating Scale R Each solution was rated by the team on scale Excellent 9-10 of 0 to 10 for each criterion. The rating was Good 7-8 Multiplied by the criterion weight and then Fair 5-6 summed. The Hydrogen solution was chosen Poor 3-4 as the optimum. Unsatisfactory 0-2 The decision matrix was the method chosen for determining the best solution for storing energy. The matrix shown above, Table 3. 4 , provides a fair comparison of all the alternatives created by the team. The first two columns list the criteria and their particular weights in percent. Going across the matrix and evaluating each alternative against a single criterion gives the rating score. Multiplying that score with the weight given for each specific criterion obtains each point value, which is then totaled after all criteria is evaluated. The solution with the highest point value, in this case the hydrogen system, is considered the best solution for storing energy. When looking into each criterion it is easy to see why the hydrogen system was chosen as the best possible solution. Overall costs for each solution were very high, but when compared to the other alternatives the hydrogen system came out to be the most inexpensive option. The safety of all three solutions was rated similarly because each option was equally as feasible in this criterion. The section that had the biggest impact when it came to the point values was the functionality criterion. The functionality criterion was based on how each solution could use the energy that was being stored. The group wanted to look into the possibility of using the wind turbine and energy storage for not only powering the house with electricity but for other options such as powering the car and farm equipment. The flywheel and water tower were very limited in their capabilities of transporting the energy from one thing to another. Their main purpose was just to store the energy, therefore giving their functionality a low score. The hydrogen system was however adequate in meeting all the demands. It could store the energy for later use, transport it to the house for power, and with the technology available it could also be used to power the car, laptop, and even a cell phone. With all these capabilities the hydrogen system was given a ten for functionality as compared to the alternative solutions which both received a two. When evaluating size, the hydrogen system provided a more feasible solution than the alternatives. With the constraints given for the amount of energy that needed to be stored both the water tower and the flywheel would have to be an overpowering size. When looking into the size of a hydrogen storage system, with the same constraints applied, the estimated size would be that of a household washing machine, thus making the hydrogen system a far better option in the size criterion than the flywheel and the water tower. Overall, when analyzing the point values of all three of the solutions, the hydrogen system scores the greatest value. When looking closer at each criterion it is easy to understand how the hydrogen system is more proficient in not only storing the energy needed, but also being able to be transported and used for multiple purposes. With more capabilities for use than those of the flywheel and water tower the decision was made to go with a hydrogen storage system to be used with the wind turbine and tower. Section 4: Needs Assessment Section 4.1: Seasonal Demands The amount of energy used during each month in an average Iowa home was found by looking at an electric bill comparison1. Figure 4. 1 displays the results that were found. The periods that require the most energy are winter and summer due to heating and air conditioning. July requires the most energy, just less than 1,400 kWh. April is the month with the least energy demands at slightly above 1,100 kWh. The annual demand is 14,800 kWh, an average of about 1,200 kWh per month. Figure 4. 1 : Energy used each month Seasonal Supply The wind supply does not follow this same pattern. Instead, it peaks during the spring months and is fairly high during the winter. However, it does drop down drastically during the summer, when the demands are peaking. All wind turbines follow this pattern, no matter what size and height of tower since the production amount varies directly with the supply of wind. By using the Iowa Energy Center online2, the total production of several systems could be found. This was done by simply comparing the same system at different heights and comparing production. The possible solutions that were explored involved one system creating enough electricity from wind that there would be very little storage. In this system, the supply virtually never goes below the demand. Overall, this system produced 25,700 kWh per year, overproducing by 75%. The next production system dropped slightly below the average during two months. This produced 22,500 kWh per year, an overproduction of 50%. The final looked-at solution dipped below the average demand during the entire summer. This system produced 17,700 kWh, which still overproduced by 20%. The annual break-down is given in Table 4. 1 : Table 4. 1 : Energy production with different tower heights Month 50 ft.(kWh) 100 ft.(kWh) 150 ft.(kWh) Jan 1,525 1,966 2,257 Feb 1,397 1,779 2,029 Mar 1,748 2,214 2,516 Apr 1,763 2,201 2,480 May 1,372 1,760 2,018 June 1,145 1,494 1,729 July 860 1,153 1,360 Aug 813 1,097 1,300 Sep 1,011 1,350 1,584 Oct 1,304 1,716 1,993 Nov 1,511 1,924 2,188 Dec 1,522 1,949 2,226 Total 17,693 22,509 25,659 Section 4.2: Analysis of production Figure 4. 2 .1 is a graph of the excess and deficit. During the summer months, the 50 ft. tower lacks 1,300 kWh, and the 100 ft. tower is 500 kWh below demand. The 150 ft. tower is virtually always above the demand and has no deficit. The deficit numbers are the amount of storage the system would need to store during the months of excess to be able to provide energy during the months of under-production. Figure 4. 2 .1 : Monthly production compared to monthly demand Since all of the systems produce more than is demanded during the year, the next step is to determine whether it would be cheaper to build a bigger wind turbine and tower that produces more energy and requires less storage, or to have a smaller turbine system which requires a much larger storage system. In order to determine the best possible solution, costs of various turbines, towers, and hydrogen storage systems must be researched. Figure 4.2.2 below demonstrates how each system's production compares to the other systems' and also the actual and average demands. Figure 4.2.2 : Comparing systems Section 5: Cost Analysis Section 5.1: Cost of Turbines Within the cost analysis of the wind turbine we have come up with five different combinations of height of wind turbine, size of the turbine, and number of turbines. The prices for everything that we would need for the different turbine combinations have been researched. Recommendations for optimal configurations are based on this data and the amount of storage. The 5 combinations are: Table 5.1 Combination Company Turbine Size (# of Turbines) Tower Height (ft.) A Whisper 3.0 kW (2) 150 B Whisper 4.5 kW (2) 120 C Whisper 4.5 kW (3) 80 D Jacobs 10 kW (1) 100 E Excel 10 kW (1) 100 Combination A: Through our research we found that we would need two of them raised to a height of 150 feet when on their towers. These turbines cost $6,130 each. This made our pricing for this combination to $12,260 without the tower costs. We were not able to find the costs of a 150 foot tower. We did find the pricing of 120 foot towers which was which was $9,200. Through simple figuring it is easy to see that a 150 foot tower would have to cost more than a 120 foot tower for the shear fact that the tower is taller. In this scenario we will need to be able to store 463 or more kilowatt hours as to make up for the months that we cannot produce enough power from our turbines. Combination B: In the second combination we have a 4.5 kilowatt turbine produced by Whisper mounted on a 120 foot towers. We will use two of this combination. The turbines cost $5,790 each which brings the turbine total to $11,580. Then the towers will cost $9,200, therefore, the full cost of the towers will be $18,400. This brings the full cost for this scenario to $29,980. With this scenario we will need to store at least 953 kilowatt hours. Combination C: For our third scenario we will need to store 289 kilowatt hours for the months we are not able to produce enough energy. We will be using the same 4.5 kilowatt turbine as in scenario two. In this scenario we will use three turbines put on 80 foot towers. The total cost of the three turbines comes to $17,370. In our research we were able to find 80 foot towers costing $870 each. Therefore, the total cost of the towers is $2,610. The total cost of this whole scenario comes to $19,980. Combinations D & E : In fourth scenario we will be using one Jacob's 10 kilowatt turbine set on a tower that is 100 feet tall. The 100 foot tower pricing came out to $7,800. We were not able to find any prices on the Jacob's 10 kilowatt turbine. In this scenario we would need to be able to store at least 467 kilowatt hours of energy. If we estimate that this turbine must cost similar to the Excel 10 kW turbine then the price would be around $20,000. With that estimation the total would be around $27,800. In the final scenario we will be using an Excel 10 kilowatt turbine placed on top of a 100 foot tower. The Excel turbine costs $19,900. The tower that we will be using will cost $7,800. This will bring the total for this scenario to $27,700. In this scenario there will have to be storage for 629 kilowatt hours of energy. Figure 5.1.1 While looking over all the scenarios it is understandable that you need to take in to account the amount of maintenance that will be done on the turbines. Most of the time more turbines would equal more maintenance, but because the one turbine options are larger turbines there is a possibility that they would need more maintenance. Therefore, the scenarios that had two or three turbines could have higher maintenance costs than those with only one turbine, but that is not necessarily true just more likely. At the same time those with more turbines continually needed less stored energy. Therefore, there would be less storage costs when more than one turbine was used. Though, the maintenance costs could be slightly higher in the third scenario; the low amount of storage needed the amount spent on storage materials would be considerably lower. For that reason we feel that scenario three is the most viable one for our needs. Therefore, we will be recommending three 4.5 kilowatt turbines on 80 foot towers to produce the energy needed to run our farm. Figure 5.1.2 Section 5.2: Cost of Wind Towers Introduction to wind towers Wind Towers are an easy way to increase the amount of energy produced by a wind generator. In Figure 5.2.1 you can see that as height above the ground increases so does the wind speed. The wind tower also allows the farmer to keep the wind generator danger a safe distance away. Height and wind energy Wind energy increases also depending on the location of the wind turbine and tower. When the wind tower is in a place that is flat there is an increase in energy. Also as illustrated in Figure 5.2 . 2 you can see that when there are tall objects obstructing the wind the wind speed decreases. So the ideal place for a wind turbine to be placed is in the middle of a field filled with a short crop. This placement will give the user easier access to a slightly higher speed wind source. Different types of wind towers One of the big differences in wind towers is the many options. An interesting fact about towers is that there are several different types. The different types of towers are illustrated in Figure 5.2.3. The Guyed tower is a tower that has wires helping to support the structure. A lattice tower is a tower that uses angle iron and different geometrical shapes to produce a stable tower that supports its self and the wind turbine. There are Pole tower Lattice tower Guyed tower some towers that are just a pole sticking out of the ground; however, these structures are very weak and unreliable. There is also the possibility of a tower that can tilt up or down there are several methods to achieve this goal as seen in Figure 5.2.4. One of the final choices that farmer bob has in choosing a wind tower is the possibility of attaching it to an already standing building. This gives additional height. The drawbacks to this could be the stability of the building, the location of the building, and the availability of a building large and strong enough to support a wind tower and turbine. Tilt up towers Cost The most likely deciding factor when it comes to our tower is the cost. Most wind turbines will fit the different types of towers with little or no modifications. Therefore, the type of tower is not a determining factor in the cost of the wind turbine tower. The wind towers cost varies with height and brand, the brand of wind turbine being the most important factor in purchasing a wind tower. This is shown in F igure 5.2.5. the cost according to height is not the determining factor it is the type of tower that is most likely to be the deciding factor.

After doing a cost analysis of the hydrogen system for each alternative form of storage it was decided to go with a gas storage tank. This decision was made on the basis of cost mainly with safety, size, and efficiency also being considered. In terms of safety the metal hydrides are the safest of the three solutions with gas and liquid hydrogen being equally rated for safety. These three solutions are almost equivalent in size for storing. For more information about size, safety, and efficiency please refer back to the hydrogen system section of the report. For each solution a fuel cell and an electrolyzer are needed, using the models listed above the cost of the system would be $74,250 plus the cost of the storage. When using a gas storage tank with the fuel cell and electrolyzer a total cost of $77,632.50 is estimated for 100,000 liters stored. This price estimate is far less than those of the metal hydride or liquid hydrogen storage options, making gas storage the best possible solution. Section 5.4: Electrolysis Experiment Using a small electrolyzer we composed a series of experiments in order to test various aspects of the electrolyzer by varying salt content and voltage. The first set of trials consisted of an electrolyzer connected to a voltmeter and an ac generator. By varying the salt content of the electrolyte in the electrolyzer and keeping the voltage close to constant, we observed the output of hydrogen with each addition of salt content. Figure 5.4.1 illustrates the changing efficiency of the electrolyzer as the salt content changes. From this graph we find that the efficiency of the electrolyzer rises as the salt content rises, but the efficiency starts to decreases after a certain maximum point of salt content efficiency. Figure 5.4.1 The next set of trials was conducted by varying the voltage, and measuring the hydrogen output. From the results, it was concluded that small voltages produced the greatest efficiencies for the electrolyzer. Figure 5.4.2 illustrates the efficiency with varying voltage, while Figure 5.4.3 shows the hydrogen output with varying voltage. Figure 5.4.2 Figure 5.4.3 It was observed that the efficiency of the electrolyzer was also low. This was especially clear once the efficiency of the fuel cell was measured and found to be much higher than that of the electrolyzer. The efficiency of the demonstration fuel cell was found to be at 64%, which was much higher than the 3.5% noted from the demonstration electrolyzer. Section 6: Conclusion It is feasible for Farmer Bob to have a wind turbine to generate all his electricity. He has the opportunity to use any wind turbine, but he needs a wind turbine that will produce enough electricity for all his uses every month; also, he does not need a wind turbine that will generate way too much electricity. It was found that farmer Bob would best be suited with one of the five turbine options that was stated in section 5.1. Farmer Bob would get greatest efficiency out of the wind turbine if he placed it on top of a hill. Farmer Bob needs a way to save the energy created by the wind turbine for days when there is little or no wind. Batteries, a water tower, and a flywheel were all ideas that are not going to be used because they all have too many disadvantages compared to a hydrogen system. See S ection 1 . A hydrogen system is the most feasible system for farmer Bob to store the energy that the wind turbine generates. Hydrogen cylinders are also the best type of hydrogen saving system that farmer Bob could use. Compared to the cost, hydrogen cylinders are the safest and most reliable. See p. 27 . When it comes to farmer Bob's cars or trucks, he will not feasibly be able to run the vehicles on the energy the wind turbine generates. The use of hydrogen is how the energy is going to be saved. Hydrogen has already been proven to power vehicles engines, but at a high cost. For farmer Bob the cost of converting his vehicles engines to run on a hydrogen fuel source wouldn't be too expensive, but getting the extra hydrogen to fuel his engine would be expensive. Plus, hydrogen powered vehicles do not have the same output as normal gasoline engines. Therefore, it would end up costing farmer Bob more to run his cars on hydrogen than it would to run his cars and trucks on the current fuel source of gasoline.
