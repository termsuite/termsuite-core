Figures Introduction I am an Electrical Engineering student from CPUT Cape Town doing my in-service experimental training at the Electrical Machines Research Laboratory in the Electrical Engineering Department at Stellenbosch University as a technical assistant. This is my first Projects report. I work in a post graduate research laboratory with post graduate students doing research for their post graduate education. The students I am working with are students busy with their MsC Eng degree or PHD Eng degree. One of our main focuses is renewable energy in the form of environmentally friendly electrical generation and we also spend a great amount of time in research and the construction of electrical vehicles. This project report is going to focus the assembly, erecting and testing a 3kW Axial Flux Air Core Wind generator which powers a motor which drives a centrifugal pump. This pump is going to pump water from a lower tank to an upper tank which is situated in the lab and the amount of water pumped is going to be compared to the wind speed at that specific time and the efficiency of the system is going to be determined with this data. In this report I am going to focus on the Wind generator driven pump system and what my contribution to the project was and all of the areas that I was personally involved in. The system was designed by Edward Lenner who finished with his Msc Eng degree in Electrical Engineering in 2008. Edward and I work under our mentor Prof. M.J. Kamper. Edward is currently employed at a mine in Gauteng and I was put in charge to complete his pump system and retrieve valuable data from the various sensors for research purposes. We communicate via email en telephone. Theoretical investigation The whole project is based on the simple fact that the standard 50Hz 3 phase induction motors which is commonly used today can operate at variable speeds by varying the supply voltage and frequency as long as a constant Voltage to Hertz ratio is used. This system is intended to replace the traditional wind pump system commonly found in the agricultural sector. This system consists of a mechanical piston type of pump driven with galvanized steel blades. This system is highly inefficient because of its rugged construction. This project replaces that system and consists of a turbine generator which generates a varying voltage and frequency supply at variable wind speeds, induction motor which drives the pump and a pump which pump the water. Before designing the generator for the system we need to look at the behavior of the other components or parts of the system as well. At first we look at the specific pump performance curves (see fig. 1) to see where the working points for this specific pump is. The working points on the graph are where the system curve intercepts the various pump performance curves at certain speeds. The system curve is the total pressure losses made up of the distance the fluid must travel which include friction and fittings used in the pipeline. Now that we have the working points we can calculate the mechanical- and input power of the pump by using the following formulas: Mechanical power: Ph = ρgQH Where ρ = density of fluid g = gravitational constant Q = low capacity H = head. Input power: Pin = Ph/л Where л = efficiency. The pump power must be matched to points where the turbine delivers optimum power. Fig. 2 is a graph that shows the characteristics of a 3kW, 3-blade turbine at certain wind speeds. Optimum power points are indicated on the graph where the turbine is most efficient. The input power of the pump is plotted on the graph and is known as the load line. We want our system to operate as close to the optimum points as possible at certain wind speeds. In other words we are trying to get the load line as close as possible to the optimum points. The load line is shifted by playing with the ratio of the poles between the motor and generator. The system will never operate at the optimum power points because of the power losses in the motor and generator. After calculating the input power of the pump the generator and induction motor can be analyzed which deliver the mechanical power of the wind turbine shaft to the shaft of the pump. The generator and motor must be sized according to the maximum operating conditions of the turbine. The maximum wind speed on the graph in fig. 2 is 11m/s. The maximum wind speed we are designing for is 10m/s which equals to a generator speed of 250 r.p.m therefore the generators power rating is going to be 2,2kW according to the graph because that is the maximum power the turbine can deliver at 10m/s. The motor used for the system is a 2,2kW induction motor with 2-poles because it operates at lower frequencies. High frequencies cause unnecessary iron losses. The power losses in the generator and motor must be known because the total input power must be equal to the power required by the pump and the losses in the generator and motor. This will help to choose the pole ratio between the motor and generator. The losses are calculated as follow: Rfe = 3Ep² / Pfe Where Ep = volt drop over stator iron losses Pfe = Stator iron power loss. After the calculations we find that 1:10 ratio causes the pump to operate closest to the optimum operation points. This translates that the generator must have 20-poles. The induced emf per phase of the generator follows a constant V/Hz ratio and is given by the following equation: Eƒ = 4.44NKwΦƒ Where N = amount of turns Kw = winding factor Φ = magnetic flux per pole and ƒ = operating frequency. The maximum open circuit induced emf is calculated to be 400VL-L. That is for a maximum speed of 250 r.p.m. The system as whole is laid out in fig 3 Practical Considerations Manufacturing of the generator The coil width, coil height and the amount of turns of each coil were specifically designed for this machine. All of these parameters influence the output voltage of the generator. The first step was to turn the windings on the winder using a Tufnell former on which the copper enameled wires was turned on. This is shown in fig 4 and 5 The specifications for the coils is as follows 18 coils needed 200 turns per coil 0.8 mm diameter copper enameled grade 1 wire is used After all 18 coils were wound; they were packed into a previously used mould in a circle. 6 Coils was connected in series to with Farrell's to form a phase. The 3 phases was then connected in a star configuration. This connection diagram is shown in fig 6 The next step was to reinforce the epoxy with weaving fiber-glass cloth. The mould was closed up. The epoxy was mixed according to specific specifications and was poured into the mould. After 24 hours the mould is set and is ready to be baked in a oven. The dried stator is baked still in the mould at 100 degrees Celsius for 4 hours and after that the heat is increased up to 110 degrees Celsius for 1 hour. The mould is left to dry overnight. The next day the stator is taken out of the mould and inspected. Part of the inspection process is to do a few measurements to check if everything is correct. I used a multimeter and measured the resistance of each phase and I used a LC meter to measure the inductance of each phase. Measurements were taken line to line and from line to neutral. The results are situated in table 1. The phases are also connected to a megger to ensure that there are no short circuits or leakage current between the phases. The completed stator is shown in fig 7 After the stator passed the inspection process, the generator assembly is started. The permanent magnet rotor and is situated on both sides of the stator. A 1 mm air gap is left between both sides of the stator and the rotor. The rotor and stator needs to be lined up so that a 1mm air gap is present across both sides of the stator and is uniform all around. This is done by inserting 1mm aluminum spacers between the rotor and the stator and aligning them up. This part of the assembly is shown in fig 8. Testing After everything is aligned, the assembly is completed and more tests are done to ensure that the generator gives out the correct voltage and that all 3 phases give a sinusoidal wave which is 120 degrees apart from each other. This test is done by connecting an oscilloscope to the phases and measuring the output voltage when the generator is turned by hand. The results of the oscilloscope are shown in fig 9. After the generator passed this test, I designed a control circuit which senses the output voltage and frequency of the generator and uses these values along with contactor to regulate the system and engage the load at the correct voltage range. If the voltage exceeds or drops below this voltage range, the load is disengaged. The system also picks up the speed by sensing the frequency and breaks the system with resistive braking if the generator were to spin out of control, bringing the speed down to the regulated voltage. Control Circuit The load is engaged when the generator produces 170V. The load is regulated between 140V and 280V. If the generator exceeds or falls below this range, the load disengages. The frequency is monitored and kept between 20Hz and 48Hz. If the frequency exceeds 51Hz or above, a contactor engages the resistive braking which brings the overall speed down to a safe and manageable amount. The control circuit and the power circuit are shown in fig 10 and fig 11. I designed the cover using a program called Autodesk Inventor. The drawing was then sent fabrinox in Paarl to be manufactured. This drawing is shown in fig 12 and 13. Erecting the generator onto the tower After the control circuit is in place, the generator ready to be put on its tower. The tower consists of a head on which the generator is mounted, a tail which keeps the generator pointing into the wind. Attached to the generator are 3 fiberglass 1.8m blades. These blades weigh only 6 kg each and are light enough to pick up speed with the smallest of breeze. The tower is designed to fold in the middle so that the generator can be assembled on the ground and pulled up using a winch and rope. This is shown in fig 14, fig 15, fig 16, fig 17, fig 18 and fig 19. After the assembly is completed, the generator is connected to the control circuit. The 2.2kw load (3ph induction motor) is also connected to the load. Test was done earlier in order to test the performance of this system and is show in table 2. This setup is shown in fig 20. A weather station is also mounted on the pole which senses and records wind speed every minute and saves the data. A flow sensor is attached to the system and will show how much cubic meter of water is pumped up to date. These data is going to be used over the next 6 months and we are going to establish the efficiency of this system by comparing the amount of water pumped at which wind speed and conclusions will be made after that Fault finding After some testing we ran into problems when the wind generator stopped. I was sent to investigate and to find the fault in the system. I used a DC constant current supply and I connected it between two phases. With this I measured the voltage and I measured the current. With these two values I determined the resistance of all three coils with the formula R = V/I I discovered that there was a short circuit in two of the phases and that is the reason why the blades do not turn, because a short circuit brakes the system electrically. The reason I used a Constant current DC supply is because if you use a multimeter or a megger, the readings is unstable and difficult to read due to the fact that the generator rotates slightly and generates a voltage. The DC supply brakes the generator and makes it stable enough to make accurate measurements. We took the generator down from the pole and tested the generator and found the there are no faults on the generator. Then I measured the cable coming from the generator head and found that there is a short circuit between the blue and yellow conductor. When we inspected the wire inside of the pole, we discovered that the cable got damaged and was squashed at the point where the pole hinges. It pressed so hard on the cable that a short occurred through the insulation. We fixed that with insulation tape and giving the cable more slack by loosening the glands a bit. After we fixed the cable, we assembled the generator back on the pole. And everything worked as it was intended to do Conclusions The generator was assembled successfully in time. A common problem is that a short circuit can occurred due to vibration. The vibration sends the pole into oscillation and if it reaches resonant frequency, the vibrations will cause the rotor to make contact with the stator and cause a flashover and creates a short circuit. These vibrations can also lead to mechanical failure of the system. There are still quite a bit of vibration on the pole, but we will see how this will affect the generator. And this can only be tested if the system runs for some time. The only way we will know if the project is successful, is to let the system run for a couple of months and compare the amount of flow to the amount of wind speed. If this project is successful, it will attract the general public, government and the private sector to invest in these types of technologies and this will create more opportunities for further studies into this field of education. I learned with this experience that theoretical concepts are not always successful in practice. It takes trial and error to perfect a product up the point where it is reliable enough to use in industry. I gained a huge amount of experience in taking measurements and using equipment to solve problems. Skills that I will definitely use in the future References Kamper, P. M. (2009, March 20).
