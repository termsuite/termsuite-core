Jeff Casalina PAGE PAGE 4 Building on the UW-Green Bay Master Plan: Promoting Sustainability Energy Generation and Conservation Options Environmental Science & Policy 763 Capstone Class Dec. 14, 2005 Jackie Blohowiak Jeff Casalina Ryuichi Iwasaki Dustin Maas There is a growing movement among college campuses to improve the sustainability and environmental consciousness of the campus experience. Rising energy prices and a backlash to the current administration policies on issues such as global climate change have sparked an interest in sustainability. For the current Seminar in Environmental Science and Policy (also known as the "Capstone Seminar") the students decided to look at sustainability options for the UW- Green Bay campus. The focus of our group is energy. Our group, consisting of Jackie Blohowiak, Ryuichi Iwasaki, Dustin Maas and Jeff Casalina, did some investigation that included two meetings with the Facilities Manager, Les Raduenz, and a tour of the "Power Plant" that generates and supplies heating and cooling for the major buildings on campus. (A misnomer, the Power Plant, does not generate any power.) Mr. Raduenz provided us with the July 2005 (the highest month for energy usage) power bill from the local utility and printouts of the entire electricity and natural gas charges and amounts consumed for the past year. He also supplied a list of campus vehicles and data on gasoline and diesel consumption. Limited Opportunities for Greater Energy Efficiencies According to Mr. Raduenz, the university has already done most of what it can to conserve energy. Thermostats are monitored at the Power Plant and are set to the most efficient comfort level possible. Budget restraints limit the number of campus vehicles, and landscape vehicle usage is curtailed by reducing the amount of grassy area that is mowed. While it would seem that there is always room for improvement, additional efficiencies appear limited by several significant factors: Many of the campus buildings were constructed in the 1970s, and retrofitting for energy savings would be prohibitively expensive, if not physically impossible. While there is the possibility of installing sub-metering (described below) to identify areas of inefficiency, changing the ventilation systems so that some rooms within a building could be heated or cooled while others in the building would not would require reworking the entire ductwork and thermostat control wiring of every building. Because campus buildings are considered commercial structures, they fall under the ASHRAE requirement of supplying a minimum of 15 cubic feet per minute per person of fresh outside air (ASHRAE, 2005). In order to comply with this standard, ventilation systems are set to provide six complete air changes per hour. All of this air is heated or cooled and then exhausted outdoors. This requirement negates many of the efficiencies common in residential construction, most notably sealing the home from the intrusion of outside air. Laboratory chemical hoods require additional exhausting of interior air to the outside. Social factors associated with different work habits and comfort requirements are also significant and not readily changeable. There are instances where one person may want to work late or on a weekend. This requires that the entire building be heated or cooled for that one person. The suggestion that night or weekend classes all be held in the same building (so that only one building needs heating and cooling) instead of throughout the campus has been met with opposition since different departments prefer to use their own buildings and may require specialized rooms such as laboratories and art studios. Mary Ann Cofrin (MAC) Hall is an example of some of the efficiencies that might be achieved if the university were given a "clean slate" in designing a new building. Constructed only three years ago, the building incorporates passive solar, photovoltaics and green construction design features. Nevertheless, its efficiencies are nominal as it only generates enough electricity to power a few computers or cell phones, and the ventilation system functions in the same manner as the other buildings on campus. If the university is serious about sustainability, new construction needs to go further in achieving energy efficiency. Sub- Metering As Mr. Raduenz mentioned, large retrofits for energy savings are expensive. Projects that are taken on by the university need to be able to pay for themselves within an acceptable period of time. Currently the electricity and natural gas for academic buildings are delivered to the physical plant where it is metered and converted to a useful form and distributed. The energy use of each building is unknown and therefore makes it difficult to quantify retrofitting projects. Sub-metering is a tool that can be used in the planning process to alleviate the quantification problem. Sub-meters measure the incoming load to each building and additional sub-meters are installed to segregate certain areas or systems in the building. Operational systems, ventilation for example, can be sub-metered to determine the load required to run the building separate from ancillary energy uses such as lighting and outlets. Lighting and electronics that run on outlets can be replaced without extensive retrofitting. Efficiencies of lights and electronics are commonly known and can be compared to Energy Star appliances requiring simple calculations eliminating the need to further sub-meter them. Once the buildings are sub-metered, facilities management would be able to locate areas with seemingly high energy consumption. This would apply to operational systems as well as ancillary energy uses. Facilities management may be unaware of all the equipment used on campus and could locate older less efficient appliances that need replacement. The operational systems that are identified as highly consumptive can be compared to similar systems allowing approximations of savings to be calculated. A prioritized list of projects would then be available after comparisons are done. Detailed renovation and retrofitting costs should be completed before starting a project to determine if an adequate payback is possible. If the project advanced to completion, sub-metering would be able to confirm the savings. The benefits of sub-metering extend beyond its use in the retrofitting process. Trends in increased energy consumption can be identified and the problem could be averted with preventative maintenance. Failures in the system could also be identified dispatching the proper resources for a rapid response. In doing so it would minimize energy loss and disruptions in the system that could halt the operations of the university. Sub-metering does require investment into equipment and maintenance. Sub-metering electricity with two sub-meters per building would cost between $5000 and $7500. The cost of steam or condensate sub-meters varies greatly with the size of the pipe. Monthly maintenance includes calibrating the meters to ensure accuracy (Energy Star, 2002). Wind Power It is apparent that physical and social factors limit significant gains in energy efficiency. Therefore, our group recommends that the university should go to the next level of energy sustainability, and install a wind turbine. A wind turbine is recommended because among all of the renewable methods of generating electricity, wind power is currently the most efficient, effectively competing with coal and natural gas (CEC, 1996). For the fiscal year of July 2004 to June 2005, all campus functions with the exception of housing consumed 18,364,911 kilowatt-hours (kW-h) of electricity at a cost of $986,046.87. Generating some or all of this electricity using wind power would reduce all types of air pollution associated with generating an equivalent amount of power using coal. Using wind power over coal to generate electricity saves about 960 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per gigawatt-hour of electricity generated (White and Kulcinski, 1998). There would also be significant reductions in: nitrogen oxides (NOx), a component of photochemical smog, sulfur dioxide (SO2), a component of acid rain, and mercury (Hg), a source of human, fish, bird and other wildlife toxicity, mercury builds up in animal tissues and can affect the heart, brain and nervous system (Schmitt, 2005). One-third of the mercury in the U.S. comes from coal-burning electric utility plants The campus would also be reducing its non-renewable fossil fuel consumption. All of these benefits would go a long way toward making the campus more sustainable. Vestas Wind Systems Educational Opportunities A wind turbine would also provide new educational opportunities. Two professors, Dr. John Katers and Dr. John Stoll, along with many others, would enjoy creating additional study opportunities based on a campus wind turbine that might include new courses and graduate student projects. Topics of interest might include: wind turbine aerodynamics, blade materials and stresses, harmonics in blades and towers, how electrical generators generate electricity, differences between direct drive, gear box and induction turbines, wind turbine output data logging, data logging software, environmental impact studies, site assessments (geography, topography), air masses and turbulence. Other area schools and colleges might also appreciate these opportunities as well. Demand Charges Considered a commercial entity, the university is billed for peak and off-peak electricity consumed as well as for a "demand charge." The demand charge represents the amount owed for the maximum amount of power required during any fifteen minute period and is billed on a per peak kilowatt basis. The demand charge for a typical summer month, when air conditioning requirements are high, are about 30 percent of typical billing charges. Our group looked for ways to reduce the demand charge. One way that may hold promise for the future is to use off-peak power to generate hydrogen that would be stored and then fed into a fuel cell during peak demand periods. The fuel cell converts the hydrogen back to electricity at the time it is most needed and most expensive. However, telephone conversations with Gary Shubach at Ballard Power Systems (a manufacturer of fuel cells) and wind energy expert, Mick Sagrillo, indicated that although there are some experimental projects, fuel cell systems are not yet reliable enough for this application. Scope, Assumptions and Limiting Conditions The best opportunity for wind power appears to be in reducing the kilowatt-hour consumption portion for the bill. There should also be strong consideration for reducing CO2, even though the financial benefits of reducing greenhouse gases may not directly accrue to the university. To this end, this report focuses primarily on a benefit-cost analysis of the installation of a General Electric 1.5 megawatt (MW) utility-scale wind turbine. A turbine this large is selected because, being one of the larger utility-scale machines, it would make a significant impact on the utility-grid electricity consumption of the university. A smaller turbine, a 100 kW Vestas V-17, is also evaluated. However, our group feels that a smaller turbine should only be considered as a "back-up" project, because while it would still provide a basis for educational opportunities, it would not significantly reduce the grid electricity consumption of the university. In addition to the selection of this particular wind turbine, the scope of this project includes several assumptions and limiting conditions: Wind. The campus is located in a U.S. Department of Energy, Class 2 wind area. (The classes range from 1-the lowest to 5-the highest in wind energy potential.) Wind turbines in a Class 2 wind area can expect to operate at 25 percent efficiency per Mick Sagrillo. This is slightly less than the 30 percent efficiency estimated for another Class 2 area utility-scale project in Colorado (Lehr, et. al., 2001) In areas with greater wind potential, such as the Dakotas and Minnesota, efficiencies of 35 percent or more can be expected (Carleton, 2004). For this report, we will err on the conservative side and select 25 percent. A wind energy site assessment was recently completed by Amy Taivalkoski (2005), an independent consultant. Her approach to wind variability was different in that she estimated the average wind speed for the various potential sites on campus and used a commercial spread sheet program to calculate reductions in the manufacturers' rated outputs (in kW) for their various turbine models. Whether estimating turbine efficiency based on experience with similar turbines in similar locations or estimating average wind speed, both approaches require professional opinion and judgment, and due to the high variability of wind, both approaches use reduced or more conservative numbers. As stated in the Taivalkoski report, "a 1.3 mph increase in the wind speed changes the payback time by 5 years!" (p. 20). Aside from this discussion, it is beyond the scope of this study to analyze which approach is more accurate. Cost for wind turbine. According to Mick Sagrillo, the installed cost for the GE 1.5 MW turbine is about $1,500,000, and the installed cost for the Vestas V-17 is about $115,000. However, he also stated that these prices are subject to their availability, and in recent years, demand from Europe and elsewhere has caused prices to start to increase. In addition, the exact location on campus will affect the amount of wiring and other infrastructure needed at the installation, and more precise prices will require proposals from wind installation companies. Therefore, the $1,500,000 and $115,000 are considered approximate prices. Discount and inflation rates. There are two types of discount rates: a nominal discount rate that is not adjusted to remove the effects of inflation, and a real discount rate , one that has been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation. A nominal discount rate of 7.5 percent is selected for this analysis, because it is recommended by the European Wind Energy Association (Morthorst, 2004) and is similar to the 7.82 percent rate used in the afore-mentioned Colorado project. With inflation at 5.1 percent (Consumer Price Index for September 2005), the real discount rate is 2.4 percent (7.5 minus 5.1). To avoid double accounting for inflation, the real discount rate is applied to annual maintenance costs and annual benefits. It could be argued that we should be using the Consumer Price Index energy rate for the energy savings achieved by the wind turbines. However, lately, the energy rate has been higher than the overall index, but the volatility of the energy rate could add significant error to long-term calculations. Maintenance costs. Mick Sagrillo, Amy Taivolkoski and windustry.org, a wind industry website that provides financial tools to evaluate potential wind projects, all suggest that maintenance cost are about one percent per year. Electricity savings. The electricity savings are a blended rate of on-peak and off-peak charges as shown on the July 2005 utility bill. As mentioned, this is discounted using the 2.4 percent rate. It should also be noted that a wind turbine will be reducing the campus electricity consumption. There will not be excess electricity to sell back to the utility, unless larger or multiple turbines are installed. This is why the blended rate of actual charges is applied, rather than a "buyback" rate, as suggested in the Wind Energy Site Assessment Report. Economic life. This is the life expectancy or period at which the turbines are expected to generate electricity. This is typically 20 to 25 years for a wind turbine. The turbines at California's Altamont Pass are still functioning after 25 years, and other projects use 25 years in their calculations (EERE, 2004). However, manufacturers' warrantees are typically less than that, which leads us to believe that 20 years is more appropriate. Utility and tax incentives. Being a state-owned facility, the university does not qualify for the same incentives that benefit homeowners and private businesses. Such incentives might include a production tax credit, cash-back award or low-interest loan. (Cash-back awards and low interest loans are Wisconsin Focus on Energy programs.) Therefore, this benefit-cost analysis is done without consideration of such benefits. Environmental benefit. Coal fired electricity plants emit approximately 974 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per million kW of electricity generated as compared to 14 tonnes per gigawatt (million kW) for wind energy, emitted indirectly because of the energy needed to build and maintain turbines and towers (White and Kulcinski, 1998). 960 tonnes (974 minus 14) is therefore used as a multiplier to estimate the amount of CO2 saved by installing the indicated turbine on campus. Under the Kyoto Protocol, "Annex I" or industrialized countries are required to reduce their CO2 emissions to about five percent below their 1990 levels by 2012. As stated in an Energy Information Agency Report, "[a]chieving the national commitments under the treaty is projected to require marginal costs for emissions reductions from domestic sources that range from $36 per metric ton of carbon dioxide in Canada to $64 per metric ton in Western Europe." (EIA, 2005) While no market yet exists for CO2 credits, these numbers give value to the CO2 reductions created by the potential campus wind turbines, and are treated as a range in the calculations. At some point, a CO2 emissions trading system may be implemented, and the university could sell CO2 credits. This would greatly reduce the cost of the turbine and its payback period. Use of financial calculator. For simplicity, all calculations including discounting and compounding are performed on a Hewlett-Packard 12C financial calculator, and relevant keystrokes are shown. These are: PMT - Payments or expenses that occur on an annual basis. PV - Present Value, a value (usually discounted) in today's dollars. FV - Future Value, a value (usually compounded) in dollars at a point in the future. n - The number of periods in years. i - The discount or inflation rate.

Considering that most university capital improvements are simply expenses borne by taxpayers, students and benefactors, a wind turbine would provide environmental and educational benefits and would pay for itself. The CO2 reduction is significant for the 1.5 MW turbine. The 3,285,000 kW-h/yr represent about 18 percent of the total annual electricity consumption of the university. Even though the university consumes substantial quantities of natural gas and generates greenhouse gases through vehicle usage and other sources, an 18 percent reduction in CO2 emissions, from electricity generation, goes a long way toward making the university compliant with the Kyoto Protocol. As stated before, the university may be able to sell CO2 credits in a future emissions trading system. UW- Green Bay would not be alone among college campuses that possess wind turbines. A growing number of campuses across the country have installed wind turbines for power generation and educational purposes. At least three colleges have utility-scale turbines either constructed or planned. Carleton College in Minnesota recently installed a 1.6 MW turbine (Carleton, 2004), and 660 kW turbines are planned for Turtle Mountain Community College in North Dakota and Fort Peck Community College in Montana, both Native American community colleges (EERE, 2004). In Wisconsin, three colleges have or are installing smaller (100 kW or less) turbines: Lakeshore Technical College, Nicolet Technical College and MATC- Mequon. Other Issues Birds: The issue of bird fatalities arises with every wind power project, and it is not limited to the U.S. (Owen, 2005). Fortunately, the consensus among people who have studied actual wind turbine projects is that the concern about birds is exaggerated. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers for the Cape Wind Energy Project, Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts (Army Corp, 2005) includes a comprehensive literature review of wind projects around the U.S. on the issue of birds. This report concludes that "[t]he number of bird fatalities at the U.S. sites reviewed is low, with the exception of the Altamont Pass site in California where collisions of diurnal raptors have been reported." The report goes on to say that: "The Altamont Pass site has a large number and high density of turbines ...  The Altamont Pass site has close spacing of turbines ...  The Altamont Pass site has perch sites for raptors on turbines (lattice tower or accessible work platform) ...  The Altamont Pass site has highly dissected topography, with turbines placed on steep hillsides ... " In addition, the Altamont Pass site has vertical spindle turbines that rotate close to the ground. This technology is no longer used. On the issue of bird migration, the report states that "migrants are typically found at higher elevations," and that migrants tend not to fly in weather with poor visibility reducing the possibility of collisions with the turbines. Bird mortality by wind turbines is miniscule compared to other hazards. On this issue, our group concluded that, because we are considering only one turbine, of a solid tower design, that there would be a minimum impact on birds (see fig. 1). Fig. 1. Bird Mortality Rates Data from Pasqualetti, M.; Johnson, G. Bats: The wind's ability to generate electricity without many of the environmental impacts associated with other energy sources (air pollution, water pollution, mercury emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with global climate change) can significantly benefit all species. Nowadays, wind farms are becoming more commonplace all over the world. Although providing a clean source of electrical power, these structures have the potential to kill both birds and bats. To understand the relationship of wind turbines and bird and bat mortality, the National Wind Coordinating Committee (NWCC) Wildlife Workgroup, which is a part of the United States Department of Agriculture, was formed in 1994 (National, 2004). The initial purpose was to provide a forum for dialogue among researchers, conservationists, wind industry representatives, and Federal, State and local officials. The workgroup has produced a report that summarizes the current knowledge about bird and bat-wind interaction (Sagrillo, 2003). The interaction of bats with wind turbines is, like many other behaviors that bats exhibit, not well understood. One of these reports, "Synthesis and Comparison of Baseline Avian and Bat Use, Raptor Nesting, and Mortality Information from Proposed and Existing Wind Developments," by WEST, Inc., released December, 2002, concludes that "bat collision mortality during the breeding season is virtually non-existent, despite the fact that relatively large numbers of bat species have been documented in close proximity to wind plants. These data suggest that wind plants do not currently impact resident breeding populations where they have been studied in the U.S." (Sagrillo, 2003). Moreover, the Buffalo Ridge report also comes to the following conclusions: the wind plant probably does not impact bat breeding populations in the project area, and preliminary data indicate that the population of bats susceptible to turbine collisions is large enough that the observed mortality is not sufficient to cause population declines (Johnson, 2003). The study concludes by putting a number on the bat mortality that ranges from 2.45 to 3.21 bat fatalities per turbine, depending on location of the wind farm. The Kewaunee County report came up with similar results. Over the two-year span of that study, researchers documented 1.16 bat fatalities per turbine per year (Howe, 2002). Adjusting for possible sampling error could bring this number as high as 4.26 bat fatalities per turbine per year (Sagrillo, 2003). Like the other studies, the Kewaunee County report found that the bulk of those killed by the wind turbines, over 90%, were migrating bats, not resident breeding populations, and no endangered or threatened species have been involved. We do know that many bats, like birds, die due to collisions with lighthouses, communications towers, tall buildings, power lines, and fences. Nevertheless, as with birds, the number of fatalities due to wind turbines is extremely low compared to collisions with other man-made structures (Johnson, 2003). Wind power and bird/bat population can and do coexist. Vestas Wind Systems Aesthetics: The issue of aesthetics is very personal. Some people consider wind turbines to be an eyesore, whereas others find them pleasing. This variation of opinion makes an appraisal of a view difficult at best, and in Wisconsin, there have been no appraisals conducted to determine the impact of wind turbines on property values. Our group feels that people should appreciate the greater environmental benefits of wind power over the less tangible benefits of a view. While there are legitimate concerns about birds, aesthetics and other issues, "[t]hese issues are often used as 'straw men' to mask other, less noble objections such as the desire not to mar a view shed, preventing the competition from a new renewable source of electricity and just the simple desire not to have these huge pieces of equipment 'in my backyard.'" (Duke University, 2005) We highly recommend that the university proceed with the installation of a 1.5 MW wind turbine. The Politic al and Financial Implications of Wind Energy Interviews: In order to gather more information about the logistics and politics of installing a wind turbine on campus, a number of interviews were conducted. Les Raduenz is the Facilities Manager at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay and he offered a number of insights regarding the installation of a wind turbine on campus. In addition, he provided a tour of the university's power plant and explained in more detail why the power plant requires the greatest amount of energy as compared to any other building on campus. Namely, he explained how there is little incentive for the university to conserve energy throughout the year because of the way that the university pays for natural gas. They do not pay for natural gas on a monthly basis. Instead they participate in fuel bidding whereby they forecast the amount of natural gas they will use throughout the year and purchase that amount for the entire year. However, if the university uses more or less than the amount set aside for them, it incurs penalty charges. This is because the natural gas supplier has set aside the gas for the university's use and would be unable to sell it to another potential customer. Therefore, there is a strong incentive for the university to consume the amount of natural gas that they originally purchased. Additionally, Mr. Raduenz explained how it is difficult to monitor the energy use in individual rooms and buildings since there are a limited number of meters throughout campus. From an energy conservation standpoint, this makes it difficult to identify which buildings are more efficient than others since multiple buildings run off the same thermostat. One solution would be to schedule night classes in the same building rather than having them scattered throughout campus. Since there are a limited number of students and faculty on campus during that time, the amount of heat going to the rest of campus could be lowered. However, some faculty members have expressed that this would be a difficult task since they need the equipment in their respective buildings to teach classes. A second interview was conducted with Chip Bircher and John Christiano from Wisconsin Public Service Corporation. Chip Bircher is the Renewable Energy Product Manager and John Christiano is the Electric Operations Consultant for Wisconsin Public Service. The purpose of the interview was to gain additional insight regarding the logistics of installing a wind turbine on campus. One issue of discussion was the issuance of rate charges. According to Mr. Bircher and Mr. Christiano, for any individual month the University is charged the peak demand rate that was achieved during that month for the entire month. Therefore, the highest amount of energy the university consumes on any given day will determine the charge per kW-h for each day of the month. This concept is important for two reasons. First, the ability of a wind turbine to offset energy costs is dependant upon peak energy costs. We cannot calculate the cost savings on a day by day basis. Rather, we need to compare the wind energy cost savings to the charges that would be incurred during peak energy demand. Furthermore, it brings up the issue of whether the university would be able to meet peak energy demands with a wind turbine, and if not, how the university would prepare to meet those energy needs. Since the wind turbine would not offset all of the energy needs, the university would have to tap into current methods of consuming energy via fossil fuel combustion. However, during times of low energy demand, it may be possible for electricity generated from the wind turbine to be banked and used at a later point in time, perhaps during peak energy demand, to help decrease the charge that would be applied for the entire month. Another obstacle that Mr. Bircher and Mr. Christiano identified is "behind the meter" installation. "Behind the meter" means that the wind turbine would be incorporated into the system after the meter that Wisconsin Public Service uses to charge the University. If it is installed further upstream, "before the meter", then the wind turbine would be considered Wisconsin Public Service property. One problem that arises with installing a large wind turbine, such as a 1.5 MW wind turbine, "behind the meter" is that it requires expensive equipment to wire into the university's electrical system since it is not intended to accept such large amounts of electricity (see fig. 2). SHAPE \* MERGEFORMAT Fig. 2. Behind the Meter Schematic Bircher, C. and Christiano, J. Lastly, Mr. Bircher and Mr. Christiano suggested that the university install a 65 kW wind turbine since they felt it would be easier to incorporate into the system. However, they felt the payback periods for both the 65 kW and 1.5 MW wind turbines would be comparable. A third interview conducted with Dr. Dean Rodeheaver and Tom Maki discussed the university's perspective on installing a wind turbine. Dr. Rodeheaver is the Assistant Chancellor for Planning and Budget and Professor of Human Development (psychology) and Tom Maki is the Vice Chancellor of Business and Finance. Dr. Rodeheaver and Mr. Maki brought up a number of issues. First, the university would only receive 3 percent of the monetary profits realized from the wind turbine. This is because the state handles most of the budgeting and divides profits among other state universities. They feel that this creates a disincentive for the university to install a wind turbine if the money would not stay localized. A major concern is public perception of a wind turbine. Both Dr. Rodeheaver and Mr. Maki are concerned that installing a wind turbine would deteriorate the relationship with the community. There has been past community concern regarding the height of the Weidner Center and the installation of the lights at the soccer field. Therefore, judging from past concerns of the community, they felt that a wind turbine would create animosity with the surrounding residents. Lastly, they were concerned with having to perform an environmental impact statement which could lead to increased time, money, and energy. Even though Dr. Rodeheaver and Mr. Maki were concerned with these issues of installing a wind turbine, they did feel that it was important to promote sustainability on campus. They suggested doing an article in the Fourth Estate on the environmental heritage of the university. They would like to see a discussion about the past, present and future of environmental stewardship on this campus. They felt that a wind turbine could be a major contribution to the environmental theme of the university. They also suggested researching other types of renewable energy sources that were not as controversial as a wind turbine and the possibility of increasing education about sustainability at freshman orientation. Opportunities Although these are valid concerns, a number of opportunities may be realized through the installation of a wind turbine on campus. The wind turbine could provide educational opportunities and may help draw students wishing to attend a university that promotes sustainability and environmental stewardship. It may also create an incentive for more students to enroll if they see an opportunity to research renewable energy. This research could apply to the wind turbine along with the sustainable techniques currently being applied to Mary Ann Cofrin Hall. Additionally, if other universities are establishing sustainability initiatives and saving money, the University of Wisconsin Green Bay could potentially experience profits realized by those universities as well. Therefore, we may in effect benefit from gains made by other state universities. One solution that Dr. Rodeheaver and Mr. Maki suggested was to install a wind turbine to supply the energy needs for campus housing. This would be an opportunity to keep the profits localized since student housing energy bills are paid for by the students. This would help students directly see the outcome in their energy use and respective bills. It would also help students experience the benefits of using renewable energy. This would directly promote sustainable living practices throughout other venues of life as well. Lastly, the wind turbine could symbolize sustainable living, if it were located near campus housing. The Energy Bill: In September 2004, the Governor's Energy Task Force was created by executive order in response to growing energy demands and concern for Wisconsin's energy infrastructure (Barth and Groves, 2004). The Task Force was to provide recommendations to the State regarding the need to decrease energy demands. The key recommendations provided by the Task Force were to increase the statewide use of renewable energy by all customers to 10 percent by 2015, to increase the State of Wisconsin's purchases of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2010, to improve the state's Focus on Energy efficiency programs by increasing the role of the Public Service commission in setting targets and funding levels for energy efficiency, to update and improve the state's energy building codes, and to create rural energy initiatives like increased use of locally developed anaerobic digesters and wind generators. Currently, these recommendations have been incorporated into an energy bill for the State of Wisconsin that was proposed in November 2005. If passed, this energy bill could generate more of an incentive for the university to install a wind generator or other source of renewable energy. Some of the components of the proposed energy bill include maintaining the public benefits fund and using it for the purpose of promoting renewable energy. Currently, the Public Benefits Fund has been raided to help balance the budget, and this bill would protect it from this practice. In the past, 40 percent of this fund has been diverted to balance the budget. Therefore, the passage of the bill would result in an "increase" to the public benefits fund by 40 percent which would lead to an increase in funding for renewable energy projects such as a wind turbine on campus. The energy bill also proposes that 10 percent of all energy produced by utilities be from renewable energy sources by 2015. This creates an incentive for utilities to purchase and build new sources of wind power to meet this requirement from the state. This may create an incentive for a utility to purchase the wind turbine themselves and maintain it for our campus. Another component of the energy bill that may affect university energy use is that it would require 20 percent of all state buildings to be LEED certified by 2011. And university buildings would fall under the definition of a state building within the energy bill. The reason for this provision in the energy bill is that many feel that the state should lead by example in renewable energy use (Stuart, 2005). If passed, the energy bill would provide for greater incentives and funding for the university to purchase a wind generator. A few sources of funding for the wind turbine may be available for the university. One source of funding may be available through Focus on Energy. Focus on Energy is a public-private partnership offering energy information and services to residential, business, and industrial customers throughout Wisconsin (Focus on Energy). If the energy bill is passed, there would be a 40 percent increase from past financial sources for Focus on Energy to distribute to customers for renewable energy projects. With a surge in funding, there may be an increased possibility for them to aid the university in purchasing a wind turbine. Utilities may be another source of funding for a wind turbine. Since utilities are looking to meet their renewable energy portfolios and may in the future be required to increase the amount of energy they produce from renewable energy sources, an incentive may exist for them to support a wind turbine project at the university. Finally, there may be private businesses throughout the local community looking to improve their public relations. The university could partner with a local business in the venture. The private business could also take advantage of the Production Tax Credit, which would allow for the business to receive tax breaks for purchasing a wind turbine. Currently, the Production Tax Credit will be extended until 2007 (Stuart, 2005). Geothermal Heat Pumps and Sustainable Thermal Energy Production The increased expansion of approximately 2,500 students proposed in the master plan will require the construction of new academic and residential buildings. Heating and cooling will require significant expenditures in the construction, operation, and maintenance of the new facilities. The heating and cooling for existing academic buildings is done centrally at the physical plant using a natural gas boiler while dormitories and on-campus apartments use natural gas furnaces to provide heat. Students are allowed to use window unit air conditioners for cooling that run using electricity. Thermal energy production and distribution on campus is currently reliant on fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal. New construction represents opportunities to break the dependence on fossil fuels and take a step toward a more sustainable campus. The use of geothermal heat pumps for heating and cooling of buildings is a sustainable option. Geothermal systems utilize the stored energy of the earth to heat and cool buildings. Electricity is still required to power the pumps but if coupled with a wind turbine, the system would produce no emissions. Using the earth as an energy source requires a geothermal exchange field. The sizing of the field is directly proportional to the energy input required by the system to adequately heat and cool the facility. To reduce the surface area requirement the exchange field can be installed vertically. According to Mike Alf of Van's Refrigeration Services Inc. (2005), every ton of system capacity requires 150 feet of bore hole and is typically drilled up to 300 feet allowing approximately 2 tons per bore hole. A minimum spacing of approximately fifteen feet between boreholes is required to eliminate the effects of neighboring bore holes. A ton of capacity can provide heating and cooling for approximately 400 square feet of academic space (Rogers, 2005) and 600 square feet for residential space (Rafferty, 2003). These are estimates for traditional buildings and the square feet serviced by ton could be increased using greener construction practices. The capital cost of a geothermal system is higher than a conventional system. This is especially true for academic buildings on this campus because only an expansion to the cooling system would be needed (Raduenz, 2005). An approximate cost of a vertical geothermal heat pump system provided by John Rogers (2005) of Vyron Corporation is $4,800 per ton of capacity. For a residential building the cost per square foot is approximately $8.00 and for an academic building it is approximately $12.00 per square foot. A major portion of the cost of the system is the exchange field. The use of a vertical exchange field adds approximately $800 per ton to the cost. This comes out to an additional $1.33 per square foot for residential buildings and $2.00 per square foot for the academic buildings. Another major cost of the system along with boring is the tubing used for the circulation of the fluid in the exchange field. The tubing used is PVC and is a petroleum product. The cost of the tubing increases as oil prices increase. The volatility of oil prices results in the fluctuation of system installation costs (Clary, 2005). The capital costs of geothermal systems may seem prohibitive. However, the capital costs are usually offset by reduced operation and maintenance costs within a half a year to five years of operation with most systems seeing a payback within three years (FHP, 2001). For the operation of a residential system, 30 percent savings can be expected over a conventional natural gas HVAC system that is 90 percent efficient (Clary, 2005). Bloomquist (1999) estimates operation costs of a vertical geothermal system based on case studies for 34 sites to be around $8.20 per square meter per year in an academic building. This is a savings of 28 percent over a traditional natural gas system. The major energy requirements of the system are the pumps. Typically a 10 horsepower pump is required for every 100 tons of cooling capacity. Energy Star® pumps are available and variable speed pumps can have EER ratings of up to 16. Geothermal heat pump systems in commercial buildings are usually forced air systems requiring motors. General Electric manufactures electrical computated motors (ECM) that identify different air requirements throughout the system and maintain the air movement as needed. This is more efficient than a typical motor that forces air at a sustained flow regardless of the actual flow needed because the ECM runs less often using less electricity (Clary, 2005) Reduced service and maintenance costs also contribute to the quick payback of geothermal systems. When the total service and maintenance costs of existing systems were distributed throughout the life of the systems, the systems saved on average 23 cents per square foot per year (Cane et al, 1998). The service and maintenance costs of the systems were an average of 25 systems surveyed by the author. The costs were compared to average service and maintenance costs provided in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers Manual. Reduced costs are attributed to the simplicity of the system. Less equipment is needed in a geothermal system than a conventional system. Economies of scale on campus may reduce this benefit in academic buildings because only one physical plant is required for multiple buildings. The heating and cooling of future buildings is an area that the university can improve the sustainability of the campus while decreasing the cost of operation. Geothermal heat pumps rely on the stored energy of the earth instead of fossil fuels and when coupled with wind energy produces no emissions. While the initial cost of the system is high, a payback can be expected within five years due to reduced operation and maintenance costs. Geothermal heat pumps should be considered for new building construction. Conservation Education As the campus moves towards sustainability, energy conservation needs to be an integral part of the process along with renewable energy. Currently energy conservation education is limited to a few paragraphs and bullets points on the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay's (2005) web page and the effectiveness is proportionate to the importance given to it. Energy conservation education can be a minimal cost investment to reduce energy consumption on the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay campus. The behaviors learned and practiced while on campus will hopefully have reaches off campus as well, in terms of the student's home and influence on others. Energy conservation education is needed because new students come to this campus annually without ever having to think about the expense and environmental ramifications of the electricity and natural gas that powers and heats their homes. While on campus, the economic cost of energy is hidden in a fixed fee every student pays at the beginning of the semester regardless of the energy wasted. Only during a crisis, is the urgency of energy conservation is realized, whether it is the first energy bill the student receives while living on his/her own or an economic shortfall in the state and schools budget. The UB Green Program at the State University of New York at Buffalo is considered one of the top campus environmental programs in the United States. In a report by IRT Environment Inc. (1996), UB Green identified the keys to a successful energy conservation education program as awareness and participation. Awareness provides the reason energy conservation is necessary, especially as it relates to sustainability, and also sets out strategies used to achieve energy conservation. Participation is the follow through. The complexity of an energy conservation education program can vary but should start out being simple and progress in complexity and extent as it gains support from the students as well as the University. Education can start with campus residents at floor meetings at the beginning of the academic year. Strategies for achievement should be affixed (so they can't be removed or thrown out) in the residents' rooms and in heavily trafficked areas. Faculty and staff should also be involved in conservation education through departmental meetings and have strategies affixed in offices. Along with the strategies for achieving energy conservation, energy bills for each building should also be posted. Students would finally be able to see the economic cost of energy use. To emphasize the effects of energy consumption and the importance of working towards sustainability, residents should calculate the environmental and social costs based on the energy the building consumed. Energy costs should remain posted as a way to compare energy use between months, seasons, and years and used as an indicator of progress. The University of Wisconsin-Green Bay's (2005) web page on energy conservation stresses the effects of energy consumption on economics and resource depletion, including coal and oil. The web site does not express its concern for the environmental and societal impacts of energy consumption and sends the wrong message to the students reading it. The website should immediately be changed to include the environmental and social consequences (see fig. 3). Global Warming Fossil fuel burning produces greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides (25% increase in atmospheric CO2 in the past 150 years). Leads to atmospheric warming and global climate change - heat waves, droughts, stronger and more frequent hurricanes, rising sea levels and coastal inundation, damaged ecosystems, species extinction, changes in agricultural productivity, migration of tropic diseases northward, etc. Air Pollution Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, ozone (smog) These pollutants can cause bronchitis and pneumonia, irritate the lungs, and cause childhood asthma. Nitrogen oxides cause the brown haze seen over many cities. Ozone can cause permanent lung damage and reduce crop yields. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides contribute to acid rain, which causes the death of lakes the world over, including the Adirondacks, even remote parts of Alaska. Water Pollution Oil spills Coal mining - acids run off into waterways and leach into ground water. Thermal water pollution - cooling water from thermal power plants kills aquatic life when returned to rivers. Land Destruction Hydropower dams - flood and destroy forestland, native lands, and destroys salmon runs and wildlife migratory routes. Strip mining (coal) Oil drilling and exploration Nuclear Dependence Problem of nuclear waste disposal -- nuclear wastes must be sequestered from the natural environment for 250,000 years. Safety issues associated with operation of older nuclear plants which have embrittled piping, pumps, etc. - increasing the possibility of ruptures and leaks and releases radioactive emissions into the air and water Possibility of catastrophic meltdown. Vulnerability to terrorist attack and massive radioactivity release. Costs and impacts associated with nuclear power plant decommissioning. Foreign Dependence Alliances with undemocratic governments in oil exporting countries and resultant human rights violations. Risks and costs of fighting oil wars. Oil revenues may fund terrorist groups. Fig. 3. Environmental and social consequences of energy consumption (UB Green, 2005) Conclusions and Recommendations World petroleum production is expected to peak within five years, and natural gas is also in diminishing supply. Meanwhile, carbon dioxide, a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion, is contributing to global climate change. The time for action-to develop new renewable energy projects and be ever vigilant for conservation opportunities-is now. We cannot afford to wait until a crisis occurs, be it political turmoil in Venezuela or the Middle East, an unusually harsh winter or some other disruption in fuel supplies, to start to look for energy alternatives. Everyone needs to put aside petty criticisms, "not in my backyard" issues and other personal motives and embrace the bigger problems facing our planet. The future of the suburban UW- Green Bay campus depends on bold, concerted action. The 2005 Capstone Energy Group has identified several significant ways to reduce energy consumption and make the campus more sustainable. We recommend that the university: Install a utility scale wind turbine to reduce grid-electricity consumption and reduce CO2 emissions. Install geothermal heating and cooling systems on all new construction. Make use of sub-metering on new and remodeled buildings to identify conservation opportunities. Be aware and take advantage of incentives, grants and other financial opportunities to reduce the initial costs and payback periods of renewable energy projects. Initiate conservation education outreach programs. Thank you to all of the people who contributed time and information toward the completion of this project, and we thank the university, in particular, Professors Michael Kraft and Kevin Fermanich, for the opportunity to work on such an interesting and rewarding project.
