A.1 Project Description Sheldon Energy LLC ("Sheldon Energy"), a subsidiary of Invenergy Wind LLC, proposes to construct the High Sheldon Wind Farm (HSWF), a wind-powered electric generating facility in the Town of Sheldon, Wyoming County, New York. The proposed HSWF will consist of installation of up to 86 wind turbines for the purpose of generating 129 Megawatts (MW) or less of electricity in the Town of Sheldon. A.2 Proposed Action Under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQR) Part 617, the proposed action will include approval for the installation and operation of up to 86 wind turbines and the associated electric lines (below grade and limited overhead), a substation and related facilities including interconnection facilities for the connection to the New York State Electric and Gas Corporation's (NYSEG) existing 230 kV transmission line, access roads, parking areas, operations and maintenance facilities, and two permanent meteorological towers. The potential siting of these facilities will be addressed in a "worst-case" scenario approach in order to ensure a thorough evaluation of the potential impacts in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) A.3 Purpose of Scoping and the SEQR Process The Sheldon Town Board ("Town Board") has received twelve (12) applications for Special Use Permits from Sheldon Energy for development of the HSWF and subsequently solicited for Lead Agency status. The Town Board identified the project as a Type 1 Action for the purposes of SEQR under 6 NYCRR Part 617 - State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR). The Town Board reviewed the potential environmental impacts of the HSWF against the criteria listed in Part 617.7 and determined that the HSWF may have a significant effect on the environment and that a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) must be prepared. Figure 1 shows a Project layout based on the initial zoning applications submitted to the Town of Sheldon (the "Zoning Application Layout"). Pursuant to Town of Sheldon Local Law 1-2003, twelve (12) separate applications have been submitted. The applications are being reviewed together to avoid segmentation. The Zoning Application Layout is the most likely Project layout based on conditions known at the time of this Scoping Document. Changes to the Zoning Application Layout may be required to accommodate SEQRA mitigation measures and other conditions. According to Part 617.8, Scoping is the process by which the Lead Agency identifies potentially significant adverse impacts that should be considered in a draft EIS. As part of the EIS process and in accordance with SEQR section 617.8, a Draft Scoping document was prepared by Sheldon Energy and submitted to the Town Board on February 2, 2005. A public scoping session was held on March 14, 2006 at 7:00 pm at the Strykersville Fire Hall, 594 Minkel Rd, Strykersville, NY. The scoping session was conducted to solicit public input for the preparation of this document and to ensure that the DEIS will include relevant public concerns and will be appropriate in its scope and content. Written comments on the draft Scope were accepted until the end of the business day on Friday, 17 March 2006. Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. has been engaged by the Sheldon Town Board to assist in the preparation of a Final Scoping document to guide the development of the DEIS. A-4 References Reference to a number of sources is either required or recommended in the body of this Scope; in addition, the following documents should be consulted during the preparation of the DEIS: "Wind Turbine Interactions with Birds and Bats: A Summary of Research Results and Remaining Questions", National Wind Coordinating Committee Fact Sheet, November 2004.

In the event that wetlands cannot be completely avoided, these areas will be identified in the DEIS and methods for minimizing wetland impacts will be addressed in the soil erosion and sedimentation plan to be included in the DEIS; and If any construction is required in State-regulated wetlands, appropriate permits will be obtained prior to the start of construction. If the Project impacts any federal jurisdiction wetlands or waters, the project will obtain an ACOE Nationwide Permit. 3.4.3 Groundwater: Characterization The DEIS will describe groundwater resources in the project area and proposed wind turbine tower foundation design, including: Proposed area, depth, and materials of construction of the wind turbine tower foundations; An evaluation of data available from the New York State Museum, New York State Geologic Survey, United State Geologic Survey and the Wyoming County Soil Conservation Service, existing studies, and onsite investigations. In addition, a survey of area well drillers will be conducted to obtain data on depth to groundwater (and water quality, if available). Provide mapped figures, if available, showing depth to groundwater table, direction of groundwater flow and public and private well locations; An evaluation of shallow groundwater (soil and near surface bedrock) conditions as identified in the geotechnical study conducted for the HSWF. The study will conduct geotechnical drilling and install piezometers to the depth of the first water-bearing interval or to top-of-rock, whichever come first, in accordance with accepted engineering practice at locations within each proposed wind turbine cluster. Prevalence of groundwater use for drinking water; Likelihood of occurrence of seasonal perched water; Quality of existing groundwater for drinking water use as determined from publicly available records and information available from local well drillers, Wyoming County Soil Conservation Service and the Town of Sheldon; and If the results of the above indicate a possible impact on groundwater quality and quantity in residential wells, a survey will be conducted to establish location, depth, use status, current production, and current quality of residential wells in order to establish a baseline for post-construction comparison. Impact Assessment The DEIS will assess impacts including, but not limited to: Potential impacts to groundwater flow, surface water recharge, and groundwater quality, based on the construction of turbine tower pads and foundations, access roads and collection systems, and potential blasting; Potential impacts to groundwater quality will be considered for short-term construction activities and long-term location of the towers; and Potential impacts to quality and quantity of private water supplies. Mitigation The DEIS will evaluate potential mitigation measures that may include: Relocation of wind turbines based identified potential impacts, if any; and Repair or replacement of impacted drinking wells, if necessary. 3.5 Wildlife and Habitat Impacts to habitat will result primarily from construction of individual turbine sites, access roads and collection systems and can in turn, impact wildlife. Impacts to wildlife may also occur as a result of wind farm operation. Temporary and short-term impacts may result from construction activities and initial operation. Potential impacts to any State or Federal listed rare, threatened, or endangered plant or animal species will be discussed in the DEIS. Special attention will be given to avian and bat species due to potential for collision with wind turbines. The New York Natural Heritage Program, NYS Department of Environmental Conservation - Division of Fish, Wildlife and Marine Resources, is considered a primary resource agency for this work. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) will also be consulted, in it's role as an interested agency, as well as published USFWS references as specified in Section A-4. Specialized studies to be completed by the project sponsor will be conducted, including: Surveys for endangered and threatened species will be done in consultation with the NY Natural Heritage Program and NYSDEC Endangered Species Unit; Bat and avian studies and field collection will be designed and carried out in consultation with NYSDEC staff. It is understood that NYSDEC established a study outline entitled "Work Plan for 2005 Preconstruction Avian and Bat Studies" dated April 2005." Avian bird studies will be designed and carried out in consultation with NYSDEC staff Post-construction avian and bat mortality monitoring will occur as determined by the NYSDEC. Habitats within and adjacent to the project area will be identified by: Aerial photographs and topographic maps showing predominant ecological communities; Identification of all NYDEC-designated Critical Environmental Areas and Audubon designated important bird areas; and Field studies, as described below. A detailed report on all studies will be appended to the DEIS and a synopsis incorporated into the DEIS text. 3.5.1 Flora and Fauna Characterization The DEIS will contain a description of the flora and fauna in the project area. A survey of flora and fauna will be conducted by a professional biologist before construction begins. Typical habitats and plant communities will be characterized and depicted on habitat maps in the DEIS, including the identification of dominant plant species in each plant community. Based on habitats observed and an evaluation of geographic distribution maps, a list will be compiled of all mammal, reptile, and amphibian species likely to be present on the site. Impact Assessment Plant Communities: The DEIS will quantify how many acres of each plant community will be impacted by construction for all project components, including turbine sites, foundations, roads, collection system, soil stockpile areas, and substation; and describe the degree of impact (from minimal to total removal); and Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibians and Fish: The DEIS will characterize any temporary displacement or permanent loss of mammal species and mortality of small mammals, reptiles and amphibians anticipated during construction and operation due to habitat loss, fragmentation, or degradation. 3.5.2 Rare, Threatened And Endangered Species Characterization The DEIS will include an assessment of impacts to rare, threatened and endangered species likely to exist in the project area. Any such species will be identified in consultation with the USFWS, the NY Natural Heritage Program and the NYSDEC endangered Species Unit and confirmed, if needed, according to the specified time limits of determinations by each agency. Field surveys of any rare, threatened or endangered species will be recorded. Habitats will be evaluated for the potential presence of rare, threatened and endangered species. Impact Assessment The DEIS will characterize any temporary displacement or permanent loss of rare, threatened and endangered species anticipated during construction and operation due to habitat loss, fragmentation, or degradation. 3.5.3 Avian species Characterization Factors influencing the magnitude of impacts to migrating birds include: 1) the presence of a migration corridor resulting from geographic and landscape features; 2) wind speed and direction relative to the migration route; 3) weather conditions, including cloud cover, fog, rain pressure fronts, etc.; and 4) migratory behaviors of the bird species present in the project vicinity. Resident birds species may be impacted depending on the habitat types presenting the project area that are important for breeding and foraging for food. Information on breeding birds will be obtained from the NYS Breeding Bird Atlas and from field studies described below; Information on nocturnal songbird migration will be obtained from onsite field studies, described below, and also from other migration studies, local and regional bird banding stations and avian experts familiar with the project area; Sheldon Energy has initiated several field studies of avian and bat use of the Project Area. These studies have been designed and implemented after consultation with the NYSDEC, and the document the numbers of birds in and passing over the Project Area. Specific study plans and procedures are provided in Appendix B and include the following types of studies: Breeding Bird Study. A field biologist will follow a prescribed survey route through the Project Area in the spring breeding season to identify and quantify resident and breeding birds present in the area. Diurnal Migrant Study. A field biologist will visit the Project Area on multiple days during the spring and fall to identify activity and use of the area by hawks and other raptors that are known to migrate during the daytime. Radar Study. Trained field technicians will operate marine radar equipment positioned in the Project Area that will count the number of and flight heights of migrating birds and bats flying through the area at night. Radar studies will be conducted during nighttime hours during the periods of expected peak spring and fall migration. Post construction mortality: A post construction avian monitoring plan may be required by the NYSDEC. Methods and results of the avian studies will be presented in reports that will be provided as appendices to the DEIS. The DEIS, with the avian study reports as appendices, will discuss: The seasonal occurrence of birds migrating through the Project Area; The potential for listed, endangered or threatened avian species to use the Project Area; The migration activity of birds through the Project; and Influence of climatic conditions on migratory activity. Impact Assessment The DEIS will assess impacts including: Potential impact of project operation on avian migration activities, considering observed species; numbers; flight patterns (including altitude); climatic conditions; regional geography; data from other studies (including mortality rates due to collisions at similar installations); data from nearby observing stations; turbine geometry , operating characteristics, and maximum tip height; and Any temporary displacement or permanent loss of migrating and locally breeding species anticipated during construction and operation due to habitat loss, fragmentation, or degradation. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: Surveys of breeding bird during construction, for two years following construction, and the fifth year after construction; Ongoing mortality studies as required by NYSDEC; Minimizing disturbance of mature forests; Modification to turbine locations, quantities, and/or heights; Maximize the distance between wind turbines and hedgerows; Paint wind turbines a color (off-white) readily visible to migrating and foraging birds and approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); Co-locate electric lines along service roads where practicable to minimize impacts to woodlands; and Minimize impacts to active agricultural and woodlands by locating service roads along existing farm roads and logging trails as much as possible. 3.5.4 Bats Characterization The DEIS will describe: Data provided by the NYSDEC on bat fatalities from wind turbine collisions at US wind farms; Results of preliminary assessments of bat prevalence in the Project Area; Studies of numbers and species of migrating and resident bats in the Project Area. Specific study plans and procedures will be included as an appendix for the following: Radar Study. Results of the spring and fall radar studies performed as part of the avian assessment will be analyzed to identify the number of radar targets likely to be bats. This will provide information to assess bat migration rates through the Project Area; Ceilometer Observations. During the spring and fall conduct of the radar studies, the technician performing the radar studies will use a ceilometer to visually identify birds or bats in the immediate vicinity of the radar station. This will provide specific information on bat activity in the location of the radar station; Acoustic Monitoring for Resident Bats. In the summer, a period when no bat migrations are expected to occur, handheld acoustic detectors will be used to sample for possible bat echolocation calls at various locations in the Project Area judged to have the ecological conditions suitable for bat activity. Results will be analyzed to provide information on the numbers and species composition of bats resident in the Project Area; Acoustic Monitoring for Migrating Bats. During spring and fall seasons, periods expected to have peak bat migration activity, acoustic detectors will be installed at ground level and at elevations above ground level to continuously detect and record possible bat echolocation calls. Results will be analyzed to provide information on the number and species composition of bats migrating through the Project Area; Impact Assessment The DEIS will assess impacts including, but not limited to: Potential impact of project operation on bat migration activities, considering observed species; numbers; flight patterns (including altitude); climatic conditions; regional geography; data from other studies (including mortality rates due to collisions at similar installations); turbine geometry, operating characteristics, and maximum tip height; Available habitat for endangered and threatened species of bats; Any temporary displacement or permanent loss of migrating and locally breeding species anticipated during construction and operation due to habitat loss, fragmentation, or degradation. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: Modification to turbine locations, quantities, and/or heights Co-locate electric lines along service roads where practicable to minimize impacts to woodlands; Minimize impacts to active agricultural and woodlands by locating service roads along existing farm roads and logging trails as much as possible; Enhancement of habitat by installation of bat boxes or other measures; and NYSDEC requested post-construction mortality monitoring to assess whether further mitigation is indicated 3.6 Visual Resources 3.6.1 Aesthetics Characterization The DEIS will characterize the existing conditions in accordance with the NYSDEC Policy Guide, "Assessing and Mitigating Visual Impacts" (DEP-00-2), including: An inventory of statewide resources, including properties listed or eligible to be listed in the National or State Register of Historic Places; here's an example Any other places in a category of aesthetic resources of statewide significance listed in the NYSDEC Policy Guide; A list of potentially sensitive receptors in the Project Viewshed based on the Comprehensive Plan Update 2001, sections 2A, 2H and 2I and discussions with the Town Board, with brief descriptions and a map showing locations of these receptors. These will include: Residences Churches Parks or recreation facilities Schools Hamlets Main highway corridors Beaver Meadow Audubon night sky study site A description of obstruction lighting required by the Federal Aviation Administration; Plans, elevations, and dimensions for the substation and associated equipment, as well as lighting needs and proposed landscaping; A description of how distance affects the apparent size and degree of contrast between an object and its surrounding. This will be divided into three categories - Foreground (0 to ½ mile), Middleground (1/2 mile to 3 miles) and Background (3-5miles to Horizon). Impact Assessment The DEIS will assess impacts by means including, but not limited to: An advanced 3-dimensional visualization model will be prepared using Arcview GIS software to prepare a "Zone of Visual Influence" map. This Viewshed map will be used to illustrate the areas in the Project Viewshed from which wind turbines could be visible. This map will consider the effects of topography, turbine height (blade at its highest point), existing vegetation, and turbine location, but it will conservatively address the effects of viewer angle, structures, and weather. Evaluation of visual impacts within a five-mile radius is consistent with the NYSDEC's Policy "Assessing and Mitigating Visual Impacts" (DEP-00-2), dated July 31, 2000. However, the DEC states that a larger radius may be appropriate for large-scale projects. For purposes of the DEIS, the Viewshed will initially be considered to be the cumulative area defined by the sum of individual viewsheds of five-mile radii centered on each turbine. If the results of the visual simulations show the impacts to be significant at the cumulative five-mile limit, then the radius of the Viewshed will be expanded for this analysis. Visual simulations from up to twenty-four (24) viewpoints selected to cover the range of typical views, viewpoints expected to have the most observers, and viewpoints considered to be historically or culturally sensitive.

Mitigation The DEIS will assess potential mitigation measures that may include: Uniform design of wind turbines and towers. A neutral, low-reflectivity finish to minimize contrast all buildings associated with the HSWF. However, paint must be an approved color (off-white) required by FAA regulations; Landscaping/fencing to partially screen HSWF buildings and help transition into the surroundings; Mandated FAA lighting at the lowest intensity required for pilot safety; Placing the majority of the electricity collection system underground; Utilizing existing farm or logging roads as service roads where possible; Design of tower heights within a cluster to be as similar as possible; Minimizing fencing, lighting, and access roads to minimize visual impact; Modification of turbine number and locations; Reduced turbine height; and Setbacks from roads and ridge tops. 3.6.2 Wind Turbine Shadow Flicker Characterization The DEIS will describe: Results of a shadow analysis to identify areas that could experience significant shadow flicker and the maximum number of hours per year and minutes per day that such shadow flicker could occur in those areas; and Identification of sensitive receptors. Impact Assessment The DEIS will assess impacts including, but not limited to: Health impacts described in professional, peer-reviewed journals, including any available information on dose-response relationship.

Impacts The DEIS will describe possible impacts, including but not limited to: Construction activities that could potentially impact archaeological resources in areas identified as archeologically sensitive; and Indirect visual impacts on existing structures that are either listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or eligible for listing on the NRHP. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: In the event a previously unknown archeological resource is discovered during construction, all work in the area will cease until representatives from the NYS OPRHP and a cultural resources company can be consulted about the appropriate action to take; The wind turbines and towers will be uniform in design and all buildings associated with the HSWF will have a neutral, low-reflectivity finish to minimize contrast. However, paint must be an approved color (off-white) required by FAA regulations; Landscaping/fencing will be used to partially screen HSWF buildings and help transition into the surroundings; Mandated FAA lighting will be the lowest intensity required for pilot safety and as consistent with requirements for avian impact; The majority of the electricity collection system will be placed underground; and Service Roads will utilize existing farm or logging roads where possible. Noise Characterization The DEIS will discuss: Mechanisms by which noise will be generated during construction (short-term) and operation (long-term), as well as the factors that can increase or decrease perceived noise levels. The most likely sources of sounds from the proposed HSWF are sounds produced during construction of the wind farm from heavy-duty vehicles and equipment; sounds produced by the wind turbines during their operation; and sounds produced during routine maintenance and repair of turbines; Regulatory guidance. Note that Local Law 1-2003 requires that sound levels be at or below 50 dB at the boundary of all non-participating properties. However, the NYSDEC Program Policy "Assessing and Mitigating Noise Impacts" (DEP-00-1) states that In non-industrial settings the SPL should probably not exceed ambient noise by more than 6 dB(A) at the receptor DEP-00-1 also states that: Appropriate receptor locations may be either at the property line of the parcel on which the facility is located or at the location of use or inhabitance on adjacent property ...  The most conservative approach utilizes the property line. The property line should be the point of reference when adjacent land use is proximal to the property line. Reference points at other locations on adjacent properties can be chosen after determining that existing property usage between the property line and the reference point would not be impaired by noise, i.e., property uses are relatively remote from the property line. Accordingly, the DEIS will characterize noise impacts in accordance with the more conservative of the Town of Sheldon Town Law 2003, the Town of Sheldon Comprehensive Plan Update 2001, and/or DEP-00-01; and Ambient noise conditions will be measured, and a baseline established for calculating noise due to the proposed HSWF, according to the following procedure: An experienced noise expert will tour the Project Area, identify the local land uses and noise sensitive receptor locations within one mile of the planned turbine locations, observe the existing sound sources and acoustic environments in the community, and select potential locations for the ambient sound monitoring program. An ambient sound survey will be performed to characterize the existing sound environment in the community areas in the vicinity of the site. The ambient sound survey will include: Continuous measurements of the overall A-weighted sound levels made for up to seven days (weather permitting) at representative community locations near each of two project meteorological towers with automatic monitors. These measurements will provide data on the variations in average ambient sound levels in the community as a function of wind speed; Collection of ambient noise levels (A-weighted and octave band data) at the two continuous monitor locations, including the vicinities of each cluster and at other representative community locations during daytime and nighttime periods. These measurements will be made manually and will be accompanied by observations of the sources of the sounds collected; Collection of ambient low-frequency sound levels (C- weighted sound levels) in the vicinity of the various clusters; All sound measurements will be made with instruments that meet the Type 1 provisions in ANSI S1.4 or IEC 651 and the provisions in ANSI S1.11 or IEC 225.In addition, the DEIS will characterize sources of noise during construction, including: Identify the numbers, types, models, size and rated noise levels of construction equipment required during each phase of construction and their duration of operation; Expected noise levels due to any blasting; Impacts The DEIS assess impacts, using methods including but not limited to: Noise levels at nearest residences or adjacent property linesassociated with the expected, combined mix of construction equipment for each phase of construction; Noise levels at nearest residences or adjacent property lines associated with construction traffic on access roads; Noise levels associated with blasting; An experienced noise consultant will build a computer model using Cadna/A software to estimate the sound to be produced by the proposed project equipment under various wind conditions at locations within one mile of the proposed project. The widely-used Cadna/A program employs ray-tracing technology that accounts for various factors, including geometric spreading, atmospheric absorption, wind conditions, ground absorption, and terrain features; Sound power levels used to model the wind turbines will be based on vendor data that is supported by field testing of operating wind turbines; The DEIS will include a report summarizing the pertinent results of the ambient sound survey and sound modeling tasks. The report will document the ambient measurements, present the estimated sound levels for the wind farm operation in tabular and graphical format, provide comparisons for a range of wind speeds, and as indicated, identify potential noise mitigation methods for the project; The DEIS will identify and discuss the potential impacts resulting from low-frequency noise generators, if any, from each of the project components; Map(s) of the Project area showing contour lines of expected wind turbine (single and combined) sound levels due to operation, as well as increases above ambient levels, based on results of computer models for the proposed Project layout. Sound contour maps shall include locations of wind turbines, residences, and property boundaries; and Evaluation of expected noise levels due to construction and due to maintenance and repair of turbines after construction. Potential impacts from noise issues will be discussed in relation to the set backs required as part of Local Law 1-2003. Mitigation The DEIS will discuss potential mitigation measures that may include: Working with contractors to minimize the construction noise generated. Best management practices will be implemented such as turning off engines when not in use, maintaining equipment in good working order and using adequate engine covers and mufflers in order to minimize noise, scheduling simultaneous operation of heavy equipment to limit the total duration of noise exposure (noise levels are logarithmically rather than arithmetically additive); Restricting hours of operation to reasonable daytime hours in accordance with applicable Town Law; Mandatory property line setbacks for non-participating permanent residences to mitigate operational noise. A specific setback distance will be recommended. Other setbacks to non-participating, non-permanent residences and property lines may be established; and Other mitigation measures as outlined in DEP-00-01. 3.9 Socioeconomics Characterization The DEIS will describe the existing economic conditions and resources, including: Pioneer and Attica Central School Districts; Police, fire, and emergency service providers serving the Project Area; Services of Employment (NYS Dept. of Labor data); Town of Sheldon tax base information; State and local tax or other financial incentives for development of wind farms; Proposed PILOT agreement between the Town of Sheldon and the applicant; Typical PILOT agreements in other New York communities with wind farm developments; Commercial businesses in the Project Area; Local demographics; and Identification, by interviews with representative local businesses, the ourism base in the Town of Sheldon and Wyoming County, and identification, by discussion with business and local government leaders, of wind farm impacts on tourism in other New York towns.
