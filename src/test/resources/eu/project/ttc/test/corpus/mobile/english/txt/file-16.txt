ABSTRACT
Cell phones connected to high-speed 3G networks constitute
an increasingly important class of clients on the Internet.
From the viewpoint of the servers they connect to, such de-
vices are virtually indistinguishable from conventional end-
hosts. In this study, we examine the IP addresses seen by
Internet servers for cell phone clients and make two obser-
vations. First, individual cell phones can expose different IP
addresses to servers within time spans of a few minutes, ren-
dering IP-based user identification and blocking inadequate.
Second, cell phone IP addresses do not embed geographical
information at reasonable fidelity, reducing the effectiveness
of commercial geolocation tools used by websites for fraud
detection, server selection and content customization. In ad- Figure 1: Answers to IP → Location queries pro-
